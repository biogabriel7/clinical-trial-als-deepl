Group 2 n=12: these patients will be injected intrathecally (via a standard lumbar puncture) with a total of 1.0x106 cells per kg of body weight, suspended in 2 ml and injected during one minute. Patients, assigned to 2 treatment groups based on the severity of their disease: 12 patients with early ALS (ALSFRS score of >30), and 12 patients with advanced ALS (ALSFRS score of 15-30). We will use MSCs obtained from the patients themselves, modified to produce growth factors (MSC-NTF) and inject them either in the affected muscles or in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients will be divided into two treatment groups: The first group consisting of 12 patients with early ALS will receive intramuscular injections with MSC-NTF cells at multiple muscle sites. The rationale for this type of treatment in this early stage group is that there is still not significant muscle atrophy and the neurotrophic factors produced by the inoculated stem cells can act locally on the end plates and nerve terminals or be transported retrogradely by the still surviving lower motor axons to the nerve cell bodies within the anterior horns of the spinal cord, to prevent further neuronal damage. The second group, consisting also of 12 patients who have a more progressive disease, will receive an intrathecal injection of MSC-NTF cells in order to induce the production of neurotrophic factors in the CSF and affect the motor neurons at the levels of spinal cord or anterior roots. There is also a possibility that the cells will migrate from the CSF into spinal cord parenchyma and exert their protective effects directly on motor neuron cell bodies. We have initial data indicating stabilization of the progression of ALS, in patients treated with intrathecal injections of MSC. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every 2 weeks during a ""run in period"" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the disease. During the ""run in period"" after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow Aspiration procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last ""run in period"" visit, patients of both study groups will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM or IT injection to the early and progressive ALS patients respectively.

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position and a total laminectomy was performed at the C1-C2 level to provide sufficient access to the site of the spinal cord. The dura was then incised and opened. The arachnoid was observed and opened with microscissors. If arachnoiditis was detected, a small part of the arachnoid was taken for biopsy. The dorsal surface of the spinal cord was cleared under high-power microscopic magnification. Bilateral dentate ligaments related to the laminectomy sites were cut with microscissors under a highly magnifying operative microscope. After exposure of sufficient surface on the spinal cord, avascular and safe areas were identified to inject the stem cells. Because stem cells were injected into the anterior part of the spinal cord, the depth of the injection site was measured. To avoid direct injury, 0.1 mL stem cells were injected using a 21- gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe to multiple different areas in the spinal cord. After this procedure, the spinal cord was covered with Gel Foam stem cell storage material and a piece of this material was settled on the lower cranial nerve and surface of the brain stem and a further 3 mL stem cells (at least 10 million cells) injected into it.

A ficoll density gradient separation was performed to isolate the mononuclear fraction. The BMNCs were then resuspended in 2.1 ml normal saline and loaded into two 1 ml syringes. The excess 0.1 ml was used to assess the number of BMNC obtained, their viability measured by trypan blue exclusion, and the number of CD34þ, CD117þ, and CD133þ cells by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, with continuous monitoring of motor and sensory evoked potentials, a T3-T4 laminectomy was performed to expose the underlying spinalcord. Using a purpose-modified injector device, the cells were slowly injected (approximately 3 minutes per syringe) through a22G lumbar puncture needle into the most avascular pial surface on the posterior spinal funiculus, approximately 1–2.5 mm from the midline, at a depth of 6 mm from the surface.

Baseline, six months, twelve months, eighteen months and two year (completion) testing will include the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) for staging and the following battery of tests: The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Standardized 25 foot timed gait test the Nine Hole Pegboard Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test versions 1,2,3 (MOCA), Brain imaging will be repeated at one year and two years. CSF studies have demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (ref 5). MRI volumetrics, perfusion scans and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have shown to be of excellent discriminating value among Alzheimer's dementia (AD), Parkinson's spectrum degeneration (PDD/DLB) and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) subgroups and is responsive to change as patient's progress from MCI to dementia (ref 6). All subjects will be started at 100 mg/day and the dose will be increased by 100 mg each month if the lower dose is tolerated without significant side effects. Adverse reactions will be scaled according to the CTCAE v.4. If the subject experiences severe adverse reactions at any dose, or if the subject requires dose reduction for toxicity from a dose of 100 mg/day, the subject will be removed from the study. If the subject experiences moderate adverse reactions at a dose >100 mg/day, the dose will be reduced by 100 mg and maintained at the lower dose for 1 month. If the subject experiences moderate or severe adverse reactions at this lower dose, the subject will be removed from the study. After 1 month, the dose will again be increased by 100 mg. If the subject does not experience any adverse reactions at this elevated dose, he/she will resume with the original up-titration schedule (i.e. increase by 100 mg every month up to 300 mg/day). If the subject experiences moderate symptoms at this elevated dose, the dose will again be reduced by 100 mg and will be maintained at this lower dose as the maximally tolerated dose. The duration of treatment is 1 year. To minimize risk, subjects will be seen weekly for toxicity monitoring during the first month of treatment, and biweekly during the second month of treatment. On weeks when the subject is not in for a visit, subject status will be assessed on the basis of phone calls with the respective care taker. The care taker will be determined during the QDRS staging at the time of the initial consultation. The care taker is an individual who is intimately familiar and in close contact with the subject. After the first two months, visits will be on a monthly basis. Mild, moderate, and severe adverse reactions will be reported on an ongoing basis. The rationale for such extended administration is to allow for a more reliable assessment of tolerability. The primary endpoint in evaluating tolerability will be how many of the initial 20 subjects are discontinued due to adverse reactions. Subjects will be discontinued if they have moderate or severe adverse reaction ratings according to the CTCAE, which are not remediable by dosage reduction.",062016 NCT02921477 TrialTroveID-287785,,,"ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase; BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase; SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase",287785,bosutinib (tablet),Abl receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Bcr-Abl inhibitor; Src inhibitor; Apoptosis stimulant,"Anticancer, other; Urological; Neuroprotective",I

Patients will be given the survey shortly after the physician encounter to assess baseline parameters with current cannabis use. Any patient who is ""cannabis-naïve"", defined as no use within the past year or longer, will be placed into a separate data analysis arm. The investigators will follow up with patients again at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with the online survey. Patients returning for their annual physician encounter will continue on the 3-month survey schedule until the end of the study, or if lost to follow-up. There may be slight variations in the interval based on state law, for example in Florida the in-person follow-up with the physician is required every 210 days, and some states allow for 2 year in-person visits.

Arm 3: Experimental: Life-Threatening Conditions Opioids are a class of drugs naturally found in the opium poppy plant. Opioids are often used as medicines because they contain chemicals that relax the body and can relieve pain. Prescription opioids are used mostly to treat moderate to severe pain. Opioids can also make people feel very relaxed and ""high"" - which is why they are sometimes used for non-medical reasons. This can be dangerous because opioids can be highly addictive, and overdoses and death are common. From 1999 to 2017, more than 700,000 people have died from a drug overdose. Around 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid. In 2017, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids was 6 times higher than in 1999. On average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. This study will focus on examining outcomes of patients that have been treated with cannabis as a replacement or alternative to life-threatening opioids or other prescription drugs.

Arm 4: Experimental: COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 Inhibition of viral entry and thereby spread constitute plausible therapeutic avenues. Similar to other respiratory pathogens, SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, with potential for aerosol and contact spread. It uses receptor-mediated entry into the human host via angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) that is expressed in lung tissue, as well as oral and nasal mucosa. Modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially one high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and possess anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties.

The celecoxib dosage was 800mg/day, taken orally in two divided doses (capsule size = 200mg). Subjects were instructed to take two capsules in the morning and two in the evening, preferably during or just after a meal. Subjects returned monthly for the first 4 months, then every 2 months for up to 12 months. Assessment of outcome measures was performed every 2 months. At each visit, vital signs, drug accountability, reports of concomitant medications, and reports of adverse events were recorded. Safety laboratory testing was conducted monthly for the first 4 months, then every 2 months throughout the study (complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, bilirubin, and urinalysis). Stool guaiac tests were performed every month. Death, tracheostomy, and permanent assisted ventilation were de-fined end points for the survival analysis. Serum samples were obtained from all subjects at the screening visit and at the 4- and 8-month visits, and they were stored at -80Â°C for analysis of celecoxib levels at the end of the study.",TrialTroveID-078869,,,prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2,78869,celecoxib (capsule),Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor,"GI inflammatory/bowel disorders; Hypolipaemic/Antiatherosclerotic; Dermatological; Menstruation disorders; Antiarthritic, other; Analgesic, NSAID; Cognition enhancer",Iii

,,0,,"Participants will be randomly assigned to CoQ10 (at two different dose levels) or placebo in the first stage, then the dose with greater activity vs placebo in the second stage. Duration of the trial is 9 months with a total of 7 visits. A preferred dose (2700mg) was selected in December 2006 at the end of stage 1, using data from 70 patients. Two-Stage Design QALS utilized a multicenter, randomized, stratified, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-stage, adaptive, bias-corrected, intent-to-treat (ITT) design. Stage 1 selected one of two doses CoQ10 (1,800 or 2,700mg daily) based on an initial sample comparison. Stage 2 assessed whether the preferred dose shows sufficient promise to warrant Phase III testing. Stage 1: Dose Selection The preferred dose (1,800 or 2,700mg daily) was identified using a selection procedure wherein the dose group with the smaller mean 9-month ALSFRSr decline is prefered.[36][37] In a selection procedure, the goal is to select the dose with truly better efficacy, termed a correct selection, assuming one exists. The trial was designed so that the probability of a correct selection is prespecified to be at least 80% if the true absolute difference in mean ALSFRSr decline over 9 months was 1.7 or more, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 8.4. The difference of 1.7 points represents a 20% slowing in decline, which was deemed the minimum clinically worthwhile effect. This criterion requires 35 patients at each of the two doses. If the true difference were smaller than 1.7 units, the selection procedure would still more likely than not select the dose with truly better efficacy. Unlike a conventional hypothesis test procedure, no statements of statistical significance are contemplated in a selection procedure, so control of type I error is irrelevant. This allowed use of the relatively small sample size of n = 35 per group. Stage 2: Efficacy Efficacy was assessed by comparing the dose preferred in Stage 1 against placebo in a one-sided nonsuperiority ( futility) test.[38-40] The primary null hypothesis was that CoQ10 reduces the mean ALSFRSr decline over 9 months by at least 20% compared to placebo - in short, that CoQ10 is promising. It was tested against the alternative that CoQ10 reduces the mean ALSFRSr decline by less than 20% over 9 months compared to placebo, at one-sided alpha = 0.10. The 20% criterion was deemed the minimum worthwhile improvement over placebo. Therefore, rejection of the null hypothesis would indicate that proceeding to Phase III is not sufficiently promising to warrant further investigation, and, in that sense, is futile. The design specified power of more than 80% to reject the null hypothesis if the true mean ALSFRSr decline in the preferred dose of CoQ10 were at least 10% higher than in the placebo group. For this, 75 patients in each group (preferred dose and placebo) were required. In Stage 2 the preferred CoQ10 dose and placebo were compared on the change from baseline to month 9 for three secondary outcomes: FVC; quality of life; and fatigue severity, by t tests at two-sided = 0.05. These outcomes were not used in the Stage 1 selection; they were analyzed in Stage 2 only. Vist Schedule: Participants had seven in-person visits scheduled at screening, baseline, months 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and a month 10 posttreatment phone call. The ALSFRS-R, FVC, and FSS data were collected at all in-person visits. The SF-36TM Health Survey and plasma 80H2dG data were obtained at the months 1, 5, and 9 visits.

All patients will be newly prescribed commercial RADICAVA® (edaravone) and, once enrolled in this study, biomarker and clinical assessments will be obtained prior to initiating RADICAVA, as well as at start of treatment and at pre-specified time points throughout the study. Patient biomarker data and disease progression assessments will be compared to samples stored at biorepositories and progression models, respectively. Participants, who are scheduled to receive Edaravone and fulfill all eligibility criteria, will be prospectively enrolled by investigators. Patients will be followed from enrollment up to 24 weeks after treatment initiation (6 treatment cycles, corresponding to a treatment period of approximately 24 weeks) or premature study discontinuation. Study will assess biomarkers for oxidative stress, inflammation, neuronal and muscle injury. Biomarkers will be measured prior to initiating treatment with RADICAVA, at the start of treatment, and at pre-specified time points throughout the 24-week study period (six cycles of treatment). As part of the study, investigators will utilize cutting-edge technology such as Oxford BioDynamics’ proprietary EpiSwitch™, which assesses a novel class of epigenetic biomarkers aimed at understanding the rate of disease progression. Additionally, SomaLogic’s SomaScan technology will measure the changing levels of approximately 5,000 proteins throughout the body, providing a comprehensive and realtime picture of biologic activity and insights that have the potential to further understanding of a treatment’s effect.

Because subjects ""cross-over"" between treatment and placebo, each subject will act as his or her own control. Description of intervention(s) / exposure: Subjects will be asked to consume two study products (placebo and active) during the screening visit. Eligible Subjects who can consume the products will enter the study and commence Run-In, a 14 day period. During the 14 day Run-In period all subjects will complete a daily telephone questionnaire through an IVRS to document information on the previous day's cramps as well as obtain information on Subjects Spacticity through the measurement of the NRS. Upon completion of the Run-In, Subjects will be randomised to one of two possible sequences (Control - Active or Active - Control). Subjects will be allocated to each sequence in a one to one ratio. Subjects will be instructed to take study product two times a day, morning and evening.. Each Cross-over Period (Periods 1 and 2) is 14 days. There will be a 7-day Wash-out between Period 1 and Period 2 Subjects will be given additional study product to account for a 3 day window and potential spills/contamination. Each treatment may include a combination of any of the following: Component of Ginger Ethanol alcohol (trace amount) Lactose Sucrose Aspartame Water Participants will consume a single oral disintegrating tablet twice daily, morning and evening. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored via product return.

Other Name: Rilutek This study consists of two treatment arms, MN-166 and matching placebo, and randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio (MN-166: placebo). Subjects will receive MN-166 (60 mg/day) versus placebo in combination with riluzole (100 mg/day) Upon completion of the Double-blind Phase, subjects randomized to the placebo arm will continue for an additional 6 months and will receive open-label MN-166. If there are no safety or tolerability concerns in the MN-166 treated group, a decision will be made to extend participation to the MN-166 treated group into the Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase. Participants will be randomized (like flipping a coin) into 1 of 2 groups: group 1 will receive ibudilast with riluzole; group 2 will receive placebo (which looks like the ibudilast table, but has no active ingredients) with riluzole. This part of the study is called “double blind,” meaning neither the study staff nor the study patients will know which group the participants are in. After completing the double-blind phase, subjects randomized to the placebo arm will begin to receive ibudilast for an additional 6 months so that researchers can further evaluate the drug’s safety and tolerability. If researchers find no concerns, they will decide whether to extend participation to the ibudilast-treated group for an additional six months.

No placebo was administered. This was an ""active comparator"" study aimed, for ethical reasons, to compare the test treatment (lithium) to the standard-of-care therapy (riluzole). Moreover, fewer patients were recruited for lithium because it was the first time of testing lithium in ALS (""not balanced design""). Patients were not blind to treatment and neither was the on-site neurologist, who adjusted the oral dose of lithium to plasma levels and monitored side effects and adverse events. However, the clinical evaluator for neurological scales did not work routinely on-site and was not allowed to exchange any information either with patients or with the on-site neurologists [""single blind evaluator,"" where the blinding refers to the examining physician]. The daily oral dose and mostly the plasma concentration (0.4-0.8 mEq/liter, with >80% ranging from 0.4-0.6 mEq/liter) of lithium was selected to inhibit phosphatidylinositol turnover on the basis of preclinical data to activate autophagy and to minimize the chance of side effects.

A total of 66 subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 6 ascending single dose and 3 ascending multiple dose cohorts. Subjects will only be allowed to enrol in one cohort. Part A - Single Escalating Dose: Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of NB-4746 or placebo administered as an oral solution on day 1. There will be 6 ascending dose cohorts in Part A with 7 participants per cohort. The proposed dose levels for cohorts 1 through to 6 are 50, 100, 175, 300, 450 and 600mg as a single oral dose. Participants must fast for at least 10 hours prior to administration. Administration will occur under supervision. Sentinel dosing will occur within each cohort, whereby on Day 1, the first 2 subjects will receive NB-4746 or placebo as assigned per the 1:1 randomization schedule. A minimum of 48 hours following sentinel dosing, following safety assessment by the Principal Investigator (PI), the remaining 5 subjects in each cohort will be randomly assigned to receive NB-4746 or placebo in a 4:1 ratio. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety and 24-hour PK data together in a blinded manner and approve or deny escalation to the next higher dose. Each follow-on cohort will not commence dosing until a minimum of 6 subjects from the prior cohort have completed their in-house/confinement period. Part B - Multiple Ascending Doses: Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive multiple doses of NB-4746 or placebo administered as an oral solution for 10 days. NB-4746 or placebo will be administered once on day 1 (single dose in the morning (AM)), twice a day (BID) 12 hours apart on days 2 to 9, and a single dose in the morning (AM) of day 10. There will be 3 ascending dose cohorts in Part B with 8 participants per cohort. The proposed dose levels for cohorts 1 through to 3 are 100, 250 and 400mg, but may be revised depending on the results of part A. Participants must fast for at least 10 hours prior to administration. Administration will occur under supervision. Sentinel dosing will occur within each cohort, whereby on Day 1, the first 2 subjects will receive NB-4746 or placebo for 10 days in a 1:1 randomization ratio. A minimum of 48 hours following the second (PM) dose of study drug on Day 3 in these 2 “sentinel” subjects and following safety assessment by the PI, the remaining 6 subjects in each cohort will be randomly assigned to receive NB-4746 or placebo for 10 days in a 5:1 ratio starting on day 6 with the morning dose. Prior to the initiation the second and subsequent dosing cohorts, the SRC will review the blinded safety and PK data (if available) from a minimum of 3 days of dosing to determine if a dose escalation to the next higher can occur. Each follow-on cohort will not commence dosing until a minimum of 7 subjects from the prior cohort have completed their in-house/confinement period.

The patients will be examined at regular intervals post-surgery. The first six patients treated in the trial were non-ambulatory. First cohort of patients (n=3) received five injections of the Neuralstem’s spinal cord stem cells on one side of the spinal cord. The second cohort of three patients will receive ten injections, five on each side of the cord. All of the remaining patients in the trial will be ambulatory, and therefore represent earlier stages of disease progression. Of the ambulatory group, the first three patients will receive five injections each, unilaterally, in the lumbar region. The next three will receive ten injections each, bilaterally, in the lumbar region. After the required FDA approval, the final six patients in the trial will receive injections in the cervical region, representing both a progression of treatment up the spinal cord, as well as into more recently-diagnosed patients. The patients will be divided into groups with three patients in each group. There is no control group in this study, meaning nobody will receive placebo. All patients will receive Human Spinal Cord Derived Neural Stem cells (HSSC). The first group will be people with advanced disease who have a lot of disability. If this group of patients tolerate the procedure then the next group will be invited to join the study. Each group will be less disabled than the group that went before them. Subjects will receive injections of the HSSC into one side of the spinal cord. Subjects in this first group will be unable to walk alone. Their breathing measurements must be at least 60% while sitting and 50% when measured lying down unless they have a tracheostomy and are on a ventilator. Ventilator subjects do not need to have their breathing strength measured. AAN 2011: Three Group A subjects received 5 unilateral HSSC injections and 3 subjects received 10 bilateral HSSC injections in L2-L4 lumbar segments. Each injection contains 1x105 cells in 10ul Final cohort of patients will receive injections in the upper spinal cord area. The first three of these will receive unilateral injections in the cervical region of the spine. The next three will receive bilateral injections in the cervical region. ANA 2011: The first 3 patients received 5 unilateral injections at L2-L4, and the next 3 received 5 injections bilaterally. Patients 7–9 received 5 unilateral injections, and patients 10–12 received bilateral injections. Each injection was 10 ll of 10,000 cells/ll; patients received either 500,000 or 1 million cells through 5 or 10 injections, respectively. Number of Arms: 1 Arms 1: surgery: Experimental A sequential design of five groups will be utilized to reduce risk to subjects. The first group (Group A) will include six subjects and the subsequent groups will include three subjects per group. Each group represents both different inclusion criteria and location of surgery. Intervention: Procedure: surgical implantation Assigned Interventions: Procedure: surgical implantation human spinal cord stem cell implantation in ALS patients The study will include 5 groups of ALS patients. The first group (A) will be made up of six patients and the remaining groups will have three patients each. The groups will have slightly different inclusion criteria and receive different procedures. The first group will include patients with advanced disease who are unable to walk. This group will include both ALS patients with the ability to breathe on their own as well as those with tracheotomies and ventilators. The first three patients will have laminectomy and receive transplant injections on one side of their lower spinal cord. The second three patients in the first group will receive transplant injections on both sides of their lower spinal cord. If all goes well the next groups will be entered in order. Group B will include ALS patients that are still ambulatory. They will have transplant injections on one side of their lower spine. Group C will include ALS patients that are still ambulatory and will have transplant injections on both sides of their lower spine. Group D patients will be ambulatory with some arm dysfunction and will receive transplant injections on one side of their neck. Lastly group E will include ALS patients that are ambulatory and will receive both injections on one side of their neck and injections on both sides of their lower spine. The first 3 patients received 5 unilateral injections at L2-L4, and the next 3 received 5 injections bilaterally (total 10 injections) at the same levels. Patients 7-12 were ambulatory and had vital capacities > 60 % predicted. Patients 7-9 received 5 unilateral lumbar spinal cord injections, and patients 10-12 received bilateral lumbar injections. Each injection had a volume of 10 µ l and a cell concentration of 10,000 cells/ µ l, so patients received either 500,000 or 1 million cells through 5 or 10 injections, respectively. The next cohort of three patients is designed to receive 10 HSSC injections in the lumbar region and 5 in the cervical, for a total of 15 injections along the length of the spinal cord. In the case of the returning patients, who have already received 10 lumbar injections, they will receive five cervical injections. In additional cohorts of three patients (Cohort D and Cohort E), Cohort D has received five injections in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Cohort E will receive a total of 15 injections, 5 in the cervical region and 10 in the lumbar region. Protocol Amendment: June 05, 2012 Neuralstem PR, The amendment permits the return of three previously-treated patients to the trial to receive increased dosage of additional injections of cells. Cohorts followed a ‘‘risk escalation’’ paradigm including unilateral (n = 5) or bilateral (n = 10 total) lumbar or cervical injections. The final 3 subjects receiving cervical injections previously received bilateral lumbar injections. All injections delivered 100,000 cells, for a dosing range up to 1.5 million cells. All procedures included 5 injections per side, 100,000 cells in 10 µ l per injection. Thus, the range of doses was 500,000 cells in 5 injections to 1.5 million cells in 15 injections (patients 16 – 18). The proprietary injection apparatus was fixed to the patient ' s spine and so it was able to move simultaneously with any patient movement ( “ fl oating cannula ” ), avoiding lateral shear during the operation. All injections utilized a novel spinal-mounted stabilization and injection device to deliver 100,000 neural stem cells per injection, for a dosing range up to 1.5 million cells.",NCT01348451 NS2008-1 Study No.: 00020318 TrialTroveID-102165,,"Immunosuppressant; Anti-inflammatory GI inflammatory/bowel disorders; Immunomodulator, anti-infective; Anticancer, other; Antipruritic/inflamm, non-allergic; Dermatological; Urological; Immunological, unspecified; Immunosuppressant; Antiarthritic, other; Musculoskeletal; Antiasthma GI inflammatory/bowel disorders; Antipruritic/inflamm, allergic; Urological; Immunosuppressant; Anti-inflammatory; Antiarthritic, immunological; Musculoskeletal; Neuroprotective; Ophthalmological, other GI inflammatory/bowel disorders; Monoclonal antibody, chimaeric; Immunosuppressant; Ophthalmological, other",,102165,NSI-566RSC,Stem cell growth factor agonist,"Metabolic and enzyme disorders; Symptomatic antidiabetic; Anticancer, other; Cellular therapy, stem cell; Antiparkinsonian; Cognition enhancer; Multiple sclerosis treatment; Neurological; Neuroprotective; Ophthalmological, other",I

Currently, there are only a few FDA-approved drugs to treat ALS, but they do not have a significant impact on survival or disease progression. Therefore, researchers are looking for new and effective ways to treat ALS. The study was conducted by clinical doctors or nursing staff with more than 5 years of clinical work experience. They administered the treatment face-to-face, either at the patient's home or at the Beijing Chang’an Chinese and Western Integrated Medicine Hospital. The study was an open-label, one-arm, and non-randomized study. The treatment duration was 72 weeks. The treatment was given through intravenous injection, at a dose of 50-200 mg each time, 1 time per 1-3 days, two weeks as one treatment course, and 2 weeks intervals between courses. Sometimes, the intravenous injection was combined with atomization inhalation, which was administered once a day, 10 mg each time, beginning on the third day of treatment.

After 48 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment, patients who received tirasemtiv during those 48 weeks of double-blind treatment will be randomized to continue the tirasemtiv dose at which they completed the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment or to placebo for a four-week double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase, to evaluate both the possibility of sustained benefit or rebound decline. Patients who received placebo during the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment will continue to receive placebo during the double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase. For participants randomized to higher doses than 125 mg BID (250 mg/day), dose escalation is also slower, with participants increasing their dose every two weeks to the target dose level or to their maximum tolerated dose.

Patients in Part B will be required to decrease their riluzole dose to 50 mg once a day (QD) for 7 days prior to randomization. After this 7 day period, patients will take riluzole at 50 mg QD concurrently with their morning dose of blinded study drug. Patients will be randomized to one of four different treatment groups, to receive daily oral doses of placebo, 125 mg, 250 mg, or 375 mg of CK-2017357, respectively, in addition to 50 mg of riluzole for two weeks; clinical assessments will take place at pre-determined times during the course of treatment. Patients will also participate in follow-up evaluations one week after their final dose. A total of 49 patients with ALS were treated; 24 patients were not taking riluzole; the remainder took a stable but reduced dose of riluzole 50 mg daily. Patients (n = off/on riluzole) received single daily doses of placebo (n = 6/7), 125, 250, or 375 mg of CK-357 (n = 6/6 for all 3 CK-357 groups) for 14 days. CK-357 and riluzole levels were measured on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15. This study was performed in three parts.

In part 1, 24 patients received double-blind placebo or tirasemtiv at 125 mg, 250 mg, or 375 mg daily in a single dose. In part 2, 25 patients were randomized to the same four treatment groups. Patients in part 3 were enrolled at different study sites than parts 1 and 2. The goal of part 3 was to determine whether an ascending dose schedule would allow patients to receive a higher total dose than was given in parts 1 and 2. Riluzole dosing was the same as part 2; 27 patients from nine clinical sites received placebo (six patients) or an increasing dose of tirasemtiv (21 patients), starting at 125 mg twice daily and increasing every week by 125 mg to a maximum dose of 500 mg daily, given as 250 mg twice a day, for a total of three weeks of treatment.",CY 4024 NCT01378676 TrialTroveID-139315,,Antiparkinsonian; Antipsychotic; Neuroprotective,Unspecified,139315,tirasemtiv (tablet),Troponin calcium combination agonist,Cardiovascular; Musculoskeletal; Neuroprotective,Ii

This is a blinded study, so neither participants nor study staff will know which treatment a participant is receiving. Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin antibiotic and was administered intravenously via a central venous catheter twice a day. Assigned Interventions: Drug: ceftriaxone Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with ceftriaxone or placebo for at least 12 months. Two thirds of participants will receive ceftriaxone and one third will receive placebo. This is a blinded study, so neither participants nor study staff will know which treatment a participant is receiving. Ceftriaxone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating bacterial infections but not for treating ALS. Also, ceftriaxone has not been given to people over a long period of time, such as months or years. Arm 2: Placebo Comparator: Placebo One third of participants were assigned to placebo, or an inactive substance. This is a blinded study, so neither participants nor study staff will know which treatment a participant is receiving. Pediatric multivitamin solution was used as the placebo in this study and was administered intravenously via a central venous catheter twice a day. Assigned Interventions: Other: placebo an inactive substance This will be approximately 52 weeks long study. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with ceftriaxone or placebo for at least 12 months. The study consists of three stages. The first stage will find out if ceftriaxone enters the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the spinal cord, also called CSF) in amounts that are high enough to be of possible benefit. The second stage will look at the safety and side effects of the study drug when taken daily for 16 weeks. The third stage will try to find out whether the study drug helps people with ALS live longer. Sixty participants will take part in stages 1 and 2 and will continue on to stage 3. An additional 540 participants will take part in stage 3. Duration of the study for participants varies from 1 to 5 years, and may include up to 70 site visits. The initial phase of the trial will have three ""arms"" 1) Placebo 2X/day 2) 2gram Ceft. 2X/day 3) 2 gram Ceft. 1X + Placebo 1X/day. The dose will be administered via a Hickman (central) catheter line. Stage 3 will proceed at 4g/day. In Stage 1, 66 subjects at ten clinical sites were enrolled and randomized equally into three study groups receiving intravenous placebo, ceftriaxone 2 grams daily or ceftriaxone 4 grams daily divided BID. Participants provided serum and cerebrospinal fluid for pharmacokinetic analysis on study day 7. Participants continued their assigned treatment in Stage 2. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the data after the last participants completed 20 weeks on study drug. Participants were randomized equally into treatment arms receiving placebo twice daily, low dose (2 grams per day in the morning and placebo in the afternoon) ceftriaxone (LD) or high dose (4 grams per day divided into 2 grams twice daily) ceftriaxone (HD) administered via indwelling central venous catheter. Placebo was pediatric multivitamin matching the study drug in appearance, taste, and odor. The treatment blind was not broken after Stage 1; all subjects continued treatment in their previously assigned dosage group for Stage 2 to determine safety and tolerability after 20 weeks, inclusive of time on study drug in Stage 1. Subjects were regarded as treatment failures if they permanently discontinued study drug prior to completing 20 weeks of treatment for any reason. A dosage was considered tolerable if the proportion of treatment failures was less than 40% with 80% confidence. The randomization scheme developed by the Biostatistics Center at MGH and assigned each participant to one of the three treatment arms (placebo, LD or HD ceftriaxone) in equal proportion. There was an additional randomization to the time of the lumbar puncture for CSF sampling (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 hours after dosing). Subjects were not randomized if they had fever or catheter complications, or if caregiver was unable to demonstrate catheter care competency. In stages 1 (pharmacokinetics) and 2 (safety), participants were randomly allocated (2:1) to ceftriaxone (2 g or 4 g per day) or placebo. In stage 3 (efficacy), participants assigned to ceftriaxone in stage 2 received 4 g ceftriaxone, participants assigned to placebo in stage 2 received placebo, and new participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to 4 g ceftriaxone or placebo. Randomisation was done by a computerised randomisation sequence with permuted blocks of 3. Participants received 2 g ceftriaxone or placebo twice daily through a central venous catheter administered at home by a trained caregiver. To minimise biliary side-effects, participants assigned to ceftriaxone also received 300 mg ursodeoxycholic acid twice daily and those assigned to placebo received matched placebo capsules.",CEF-ALS -2006 CEF-ALS-2006 NCT00349622 NINDS NINDS CRC TrialTroveID-079062,,Hypolipaemic/Antiatherosclerotic,,79062,undisclosed - ceftriaxone (IV),Cell wall synthesis inhibitor,"Cephalosporin, injectable",Iii
