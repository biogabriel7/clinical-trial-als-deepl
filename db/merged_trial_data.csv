For Brain Cells To Function Normally They Must Receive A Constant Supply Of These Nutrients. As Areas Of The Brain Become More Active Blood Flow Into And Out Of These Areas Increase. In Addition To Oxygen And Glucose, The Brain Uses Chemical Compounds Known As Phospholipids. These Phospholipids Make Up The Covering Of Nerve Cells That Assist In The Transfer Of Information From Cell To Cell. Without Phospholipids Brain Cell Activity May Become Abnormal And Cause Problems In The Nervous System. Certain Diseases Like Alzheimer'S Disease And Brain Tumors Can Affect Blood Flow To The Brain And Change The Way The Brain Metabolizes Phospholipids. In Addition To Diseases, Changes In The Brain Occur With Normal Healthy Aging. This Study Is Designed To Use Pet Scan To Measure Changes In Blood Flow And Changes In Phospholipid Metabolism. Using This Technique, Researchers Can Improve Their Understanding Of How Certain Diseases Change The Shape And Function Of The Brain. Detailed Description: The Brain Physiology And Metabolism Section (Bpms) Of The National Institute On Aging (Nia) And The Clinical Neuroscience Program (Cnp) Of The National Institute Of Neurological Disorders And Stroke (Ninds) Propose To Study Regional Brain Phospholipid Metabolism In Young And Old Normal Volunteers And In Patients With Alzheimer Disease. The Method To Be Employed, Developed From Animal Studies, Involves The Intravenous Injection Of A Radiolabeled Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid, [11C]Arachidonic Acid And Measuring Regional Brain Radioactivity Using Positron Emission Tomography (Pet). A Mathematical Model Is Used To Calculate Regional Brain Incorporation Coefficients K* Of [11C]Arachidonate Into Brain. These Reflect Brain Signal Transduction And Membrane Turnover Involving Phospholipids And The Signal Transduction And Membrane Turnover Involving Phospholipids And The Activation Of The Enzyme, Phospholipase A2. Pet Also Will Be Used In The Same Subjects To Measure Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (Rcbf), A Marker Of Brain Energy Metabolism, With Radioactive Water ([150]H20). The Literature Reports That Rcbf And Energy Metabolism Decline With Age And Are Markedly Reduced In Alzheimer Disease. We Hypothesize That (A) We Will Be Able To Quantify And Image Incorporation Of [11C]Arachidonate Into The Human Brain For The First Time, (B) In Normal Volunteers, K* For Arachidonate Will Be Correlated On A Regional Basis With Rcbf, (C) Rcbf Will Be Reduced In The Older Compared With The Younger Normal Volunteers, And Markedly Reduced In Alzheimer Disease Patients Compared With The Older Volunteers (Controls), (D) The Normal Coupling (Regression) Relation Between K* And Rcbf Will Be Disturbed In Alzheimer Disease. This Protocol Originally Proposed To Measure Brain Incorporation Of Two Labeled Fatty Acids, [11C]Arachidonate And [11C]Palmitate, As Well As Rcbf, In Young And Old Normal Volunteers, And In Patients With Alzheimer Disease, Niemann-Pick Type C Disease And Brain Tumors. Eleven Patients With Alzheimer Disease Have Been Scanned Using [11C]Arachidonate And [150]H20, Compared With 10 Volunteers.

The Primary Hypothesis Is That The Proportion Of Patients Who Test Positive For Beta-Amyloid Deposition Will Vary Across Different Speech And Language Based Dementias. Detailed Description: Speech And Language Based Dementias (Slds) (Often Referred To As Primary Progressive Aphasias Or Ppa) Are Neurodegenerative Diseases In Which Speech Or Language Impairments Are The Most Salient Features Of The Disease And Explain Deficits In Activities Of Daily Living. Patients With Slds May Have Poor Grammar, Prominent Anomia, Comprehension Deficits, Speech Production And Articulation Problems, Difficulty With Repetition Of Words Or Sentences, Word Finding Pauses, Or A Combination Of All These Features. The Slds Can Be Further Divided Into Different Subtypes. Up To 50% Of Patients With Slds That Go On To Autopsy Have Shown Alzheimer Type Pathology Where Beta-Amyloid Deposition Is Observed; The Rest Have Pathology Consistent With Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Where Beta-Amyloid Deposition Is Absent. Future Disease Modifying Treatments That Target Beta-Amyloid Will Most Likely Differ From Treatments That Do Not Target Beta-Amyloid. As A Consequence, Biomarkers Are Needed To Differentiate Patients With Slds With And Without Beta-Amyloid Deposition. Little Research Has Been Done To Identify Biomarkers That Could Differentiate Patients With Slds With And Without Beta-Amyloid, Mainly Because The Gold Standard To Identify The Presence Of Beta-Amyloid Has Been Pathological Examination, Which Does Not Always Occur, And May Not Occur Until More Than 10 Years After Onset. The Recent Development Of [N-Methyl-11C]2-(4'-Methylaminophenyl)-6-Hydroxybenzothiazole Also Known As 11C Pittsburgh Compound B Or Pib Is A Solution To This Problem Since Pib Allows The In Vivo Detection Of Beta-Amyloid. Unfortunately, Pib Is Very Expensive. The Long Term Goal Of Our Research Is To Develop A Cost Effective Algorithmic Approach To The Evaluation And Diagnosis Of Patients Presenting With Slds. The Objective Of The Studies Outlined In This Proposal Is To Identify Clinical, Neuropsychological, Or Imaging Biomarkers That Are Readily Available, Relatively Inexpensive, And Non-Invasive That Will Allow The Differentiation Of Patients With Slds With And Without Beta-Amyloid Deposition. We Will Use Pib As An Indicator Of Beta-Amyloid Pathology. Our Proposal Is Predicated Upon Our Strong Preliminary Data Showing That Clinical, Neuropsychological And Radiological Features Differ Between Patients With Slds With And Without Beta-Amyloid Deposition. Our Central Hypothesis Is That Temporo-Parietal Lobe Findings Such As Memory Loss, Visuospatial/Perceptual Impairment, Parietal Lobe Atrophy On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Mri), And Parietal Lobe Hypometabolism On [18-F]-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography (Fdg-Pet), Will Be Associated With Beta-Amyloid Deposition (Pib Positive Status). On-The-Other Hand, Frontal Lobe Features, Such As Apraxia Of Speech And Behavioral And Executive Dysfunction, As Well As Extrapyramidal Features Such As Parkinsonism, Will Be Associated With Absence Of Beta-Amyloid Deposition (Pib Negative Status).

In Ftd In Particular, Hyperorality And Dietary Changes Are Associated With Metabolic And Hormonal Changes Such As Altered Levels Of The Anorexigenic Hormone Leptin. The Hypothalamus Is A Brain Region That Controls Metabolism And Hormonal Systems. Hypothalamic Function Depends On Its Ability To Sense Peripheral Signals. The Hypothalamus Sits On A Circumventricular Organ Called The Median Eminence (Me) That Puts It In Contact With Systemic Blood Circulation. In The Me, Fenestrated Capillaries Allow The Diffusion Of Bloodborne Factors. However, Despite The Lack Of Blood-Brain Barrier At Brain Microvessels, Diffusion Is Controlled By Specialized Ependymoglial Cells, The Tanycytes, Which Exert A Barrier Function Between The Me And The Third Ventricle And Controls The Access Of Blood-Borne Molecules Into The Hypothalamus. Previous Work From Our Laboratory And The Erc Consortium Has Highlighted The Role Of Tanycytes Not Only In The Regulation Of The Release Of Neurohormones From Neuroendocrine Nerve Terminals Into The Pituitary Portal Blood Circulation, But Also In The Transport Of Circulating Leptin Into The Hypothalamus. Hence Hypothalamic Dysfunction In Ad And Ftd Can Result Either From Dysregulation Of Neuroendocrine Secretions, Direct Neuronal Loss Or From Defective Transport (And Hence Resistance) To Hormones Like Leptin.

The Primary Hypothesis Is That Cognitive And Functional Performance Will Be Poorer In Atypical Alzheimer'S Subjects With Microbleeds Compared To Those Without Microbleeds. Detailed Description: Alzheimer'S Disease (Ad) Is Associated With Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (Aria). Microbleeds (Mbs) Represent Part Of The Spectrum Of Aria And Can Be Identified As Small Hypointense Lesions On Gradient-Recalled Echo (Gre) T2*-Weighted Mri. They Are Thought To Represent Hemosiderin Deposits (And Hence Have Been Classified As Aria-H1) And Occur As A Consequence Of Leakage Of Blood Products Out Of Vessels That Have Been Damaged By Deposition Of The Protein ??-Amyloid In Cerebral Vessels; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (Caa). However, It Is Also Possible That Cerebrovascular Disease Could Contribute To The Presence Of Mbs In Ad. Subjects With Mbs Are At A Greater Risk Of Bleeds Which Could Impact The Use Of Anti-Coagulation Treatment Approaches. The Presence Of Caa Has Been Particularly Associated With Ad And Studies Have Demonstrated That Mbs Occur In 12-33% Of Subjects With Typical Alzheimer'S Dementia, With A Large Proportion Of Subjects Showing Multiple Mbs. The Presence Of Mbs Has Been Associated With Older Age And A Greater Degree Of White Matter Hyperintensities (Wmh) In Alzheimer'S Dementia. The Association Between Mbs And Wmh, A Marker Of Cerebrovascular Disease, Suggests Cerebrovascular Disease May Also Play A Role In The Etiology Of Mbs In Ad. However, Approximately 16% Of Ad Subjects Do Not Present With Episodic Memory Loss, But Instead Display Language Problems Such As Poor Naming And Impaired Sentence Repetition, Or Visuospatial And Visual Perceptual Deficits, And Are Referred To As Atypical Ad. Since Ad Is Associated With Caa, One Would Assume That Caa And Hence Mbs, Would Also Occur In Atypical Ad, Although No Studies Have Assessed Mbs In Atypical Ad. Amyloid-Binding Ligands, Such As Pittsburgh Compound B (Pib), That Can Be Detected Using Pet Scanning Have Now Been Developed And Provide An Invaluable Biomarker To Infer The Presence Of ??-Amyloid. The Presence Of Caa Has Been Shown To Be Associated With Elevated Pib Uptake, And Hence The Assessment Of Pib-Pet In Subjects With Mbs Will Provide Important Information On The Association Of Mbs And ??-Amyloid Deposition In Ad. The Goal Of The Study Is To Assess The Associations Between Mbs And Demographic/Clinical Features, Assess The Associations Between Mbs And Imaging Features As Well As A Possible Correlate To The Number Of Mbs A Subject Has In Atypical Ad. Patients Found To Be Eligible And Willing To Enroll In This Study Will Be Asked To Undergo A Neurologic Examination, Neuropsychometric Testing, An Mri Scan, And A Pib Pet Scan Of The Brain. This Will Be Done Over A Period Of Two Days At The Mayo Clinic In Rochester, Minnesota.","Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment, Masking: Open Label, Primary Purpose: Diagnostic",I,Registry Only,1,1,1,0,3,3.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

Ftld Is Characterized Multiple Behavioral Symptoms Including Mental Rigidity, Irritability, Emotional Blunting, Disinhibition, Apathy, And Aggression. These Behavioural Disturbances Are Particularly Important Because They Increase Caregiver Burden And May Lead To Earlier Institutionalization. While The Causes Of Ftld Are Largely Unknown, There Is A Great Deal Of Evidence Suggesting That A Brain Chemical Called Serotonin Regulates Many Of The Behaviours That Are Disturbed In Ftld. Our Objective Is Therefore To Determine Whether Dysfunction In The Brain'S Serotonin System Is Responsible For Behavioural Problems Among Ftld Patients. We Hope To Take The First Steps Towards A Scientific Understanding Of The Behavioural Symptoms Of Ftd, And Use Our Findings To Support A Larger Study Optimizing The Treatment Of Targeted Behavioural Disturbances In Ftld Using The Antidepressant Citalopram. Citalopram Increases Transmission By Serotonin; We Plan To Use This Medication To Determine Whether There Are Any Differences In How The Serotonin System Functions In Ftld Patients Who Display Different Levels Of Behavioural Disturbances. Patients Will Be Given Citalopram And Will Have Their Blood Drawn After 2 And 3 Hours To Determine Plasma Levels Of The Hormones Cortisol And Prolactin At Those Times. These Hormones Are Good Indicators Of Serotonergic Functioning In The Central Nervous System. We Expect That Patients With Lower Levels Of Serotonergic Functioning Will Have More Severe Behavioural Disturbances And Be Less Responsive To Treatment With Citalopram. Following Their First Test Day, We Will Provide Patients With A 6-Week Supply Of Citalopram, And Assess Them For Any Changes In Behaviour At The End Of This Treatment. This Study Aims To Obtain A Better Understanding Of How Changes In The Serotonin System Relate To Behavioural Symptoms In Ftld Patients. Using The Information From This Pilot Study, We Can Plan A Larger Study To Determine Whether Certain Behaviours Will Respond To Treatment With Citalopram, And If So, Determine Whether It Is Possible To Predict Which Patients, Based On Individual Characteristics, Are Most Likely To Respond To This Treatment. This Methodology Will Therefore Not Only Provide A Scientific Rationale For Treatment Of Ftld, But Also Provide Guidance For Ongoing, Individualized Therapy. Detailed Description: Objectives: A Hallmark Of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration(Ftld) Is Its Associated Behavioural Disturbances (Bpsd), Which Include Disinhibition, Aggression, Apathy, Agitation, Depression, And Inappropriate Affect. Current Evidence Suggests That Secondary Changes In The Serotonergic System May Be Key To Many Of The Symptoms Of Ftld. Our Primary Objective Is To Evaluate The Ability Of Serotonergic Dysfunction, As Measured Through Oral Citalopram Challenge, To Predict Subsequent Behavioural Response To Pharmacotherapy With Citalopram. As A Secondary Objective, We Will Explore The Relationship Between Specific Bpsds And The Level Of Serotonergic Dysfunction. Hypotheses: We Predict That Patients With Ftld Who Respond To Citalopram Pharmacotherapy Will Show Greater Dysfunction In The Serotonergic System, As Measured By Citalopram Challenge, Than Patients Who Do Not Respond. This Hypothesis Will Be Evaluated In Vivo Using Peak Change In Plasma Concentrations Of Cortisol And Prolactin As Indicators Of Serotonergic Dysfunction Following Oral Citalopram Challenge. Research Plan: A Consecutive Sample Of Patients Attending Ftld Clinics Who Exhibit Significant Bpsd Will Be Recruited Into This Study.Because Serotonin Promotes Cortisol And Prolactin Secretion Via The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (Hpa) Axis, These Hormones Have Been Shown To Be A Reliable Marker Of Serotonergic Functioning. Their Levels Will Therefore Be Measured From Blood Samples Taken At Baseline And 2 And 3 Hours After The Administration Of 20 Mg Citalopram. Changes In Cortisol Levels After Citalopram Administration Will Be Used As The Primary Measure Of Serotonergic Functioning. We Expect To Find An Inverse Correlation Between The Cortisol Response To Citalopram Challenge And The Severity Of Bpsd According To The Total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Npi) Score. Subsequent To The Citalopram Challenge, Participants Will Be Treated For Their Bpsd With Open-Label Citalopram (20-40 Mg) For 6 Weeks. At The End Of This Period, Patients Will Be Re-Assessed With The Npi. The Magnitude Of Response, Based On Changes In Npi Scores, Will Be Correlated With The Citalopram Challenge Test Results. It Is Expected That Patients Who Show More Severe Serotonergic Dysfunction Will Have A Better Response To Daily Citalopram Treatment. Relevance: The Results Of This Study Will Further The Scientific Understanding Of The Neurochemical Basis Underlying Bpsd In Ftld. To Date, The Treatment Of Ftld Patients Has Relied Largely On The Understanding Of Treatments For Other Dementias, Due To The Lack Of Research In The Area Of Ftld. Therefore, Our Work May Aid In The Development Of Targeted Therapies Specific To Ftld.",,Iv,Registry Only,1,1,1,1,4,3.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,2,0,0,0,3,FUNCTIONAL,0,0,0,0

Als Is A Progressive Uniformly Lethal Neurodegenerative Disorder For Which There Is No Known Cure. Recent Genetic And Biochemical Studies Implicate Free Radical Toxicity, Glutamate Excitotoxicity And Mitochondrial Dysfunction As Possible Causes Of Familial Als (Fals) And Sporadic Als (Sals). It Has Been Hypothesized That In Als There May Be Involvement Of Oxidative Free Radical Damage And Impaired Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism That Could In Turn Lead To Excitotoxic Cell Death. Creatine, An Agent That Improves Mitochondrial Function, Has Been Shown To Be Neuroprotective In Animal Models Of Als And Huntington'S Disease. This Study Is A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial Of The Safety And Efficacy Of Creatine In Patients With Als Enrolled At Sites Distributed Throughout The United States, Including Northeast Als (Neals) Sites. The Study Will Provide Preliminary Data On The Safety And Efficacy Of Creatine In Als. If Creatine Slows Disease Progression In Als And Is Well Tolerated, A Phase 3 Study With Survival As The Primary Outcome Measure Will Be Initiated. 114 Eligible Subjects Will Be Randomized To Receive Treatment For 6 Months Of (1) Active Creatine Or (2) Placebo. After Randomization, Subjects Will Be Followed Prospectively For 6 Months. The Primary Outcome Measure For The Study Is The Change In Upper Extremity Motor Function After 6 Months Of Experimental Therapy As Tested With The Tufts Quantitative Neuromuscular Exam. Strength In Eight Arm Muscles Will Be Measured (Bilateral Shoulder And Elbow Flexion And Extension). Secondary Outcome Measures Include Grip Strength, Motor Unit Number Estimates (Mune), The Als Functional Rating Score-Revised (Alsfrs-R), And Rate Of Change Of A Well Established Biochemical Marker Of Oxidative Damage To Dna (8Oh2'Dg Levels In Urine), And The Safety And Tolerability Of Creatine.","Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment",Ii,Registry Only,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,2,5,0,0,0,0,7,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

One Of The Major Hallmarks Of Als Is The Denervation Of Neuromuscular Junctions (Nmjs), Which Is One Of The Earliest Events Seen In Als Patients And Mouse Models Of Als. Under Healthy Conditions, Glial Cells Called Perisynaptic Schwann Cells (Pscs) Have A Key Role In Regulating The Stability And Maintenance Of Nmjs, But They Only Participate In Nmj Repair Once Denervation Occurs. Denervation And The Subsequent Decline In Synaptic Activity Triggers A Loss Of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors (Machrs) In The Psc, And The Resulting Decrease In Machr-Mediated Gene Expression Drives The ""Repair Mode"" Of The Psc. In Assessing The Nmj Under Conditions Of Als, A Scarcity Of Process Extensions In Pscs Was Observed For Months Prior To Disease Onset In The Superoxide Dismutase 1 (Sod1) Mouse Model Of Als, Indicating Inadequate Glial Repair. Collectively, These Preclinical Findings Support The Hypothesis That Dampening Glial Machrs Will Restore The Anticipated ""Repair"" Response Of Pscs In The Nmj. Hence, The Use Of A Selective M3 Muscarinic Receptor Antagonist, Darifenacin, As A Disease-Modifying Therapeutic In Familial And Sporadic Als Could Improve Nmj Function, Resulting In A Beneficial Impact On The Autonomy And Quality Of Life Of Als Patients. The Purpose Of The Current Phase 2 Trial Is Therefore To Test The Safety, Tolerability, And Pharmacology Of Darifenacin In Patients With Als. Specifically, 30 Eligible Subjects Between 18 And 85 Years Of Age Will Take 7.5 Mg Of Darifenacin Or Placebo Daily (By Mouth) For Two Weeks Followed By An Increased Dose Of 15 Mg For The Next 22 Weeks.

The Safety And Tolerability Of Galantamine Therapy Will Be Assessed Over The Entire Treatment Period (26 Weeks). The 8 Week Withdrawal Period Will Be Used To Confirm The Safety Of Galantamine Withdrawal In This Subject Group And It Impact On Any Symptom Improvement Achieved During The First 18 Weeks Of Galantamine Treatment ( Symptom Improvement Would Be Expected To Stabilize Or Decline On Withdrawal Of An Effective Therapy). The Primary Efficacy Objective Is To Explore The Effect Of Galantamine On Behavior As Measured By The Frontal Behavioral Inventory During The Randomized Withdrawal Period. In Addition, For Subjects With Primary Progressive Aphasia (Limited Ability For Languages), The Effects Of Galantamine On Language Will Be Explored Using The Aphasia Quotient Of The Western Aphasia Battery, And For All Subjects The Clinical Global Impressions Will Be Used To Explore Global Change. Detailed Description: Pick Complex (Pc) And Frontotemporal Dementia (Ftd) Are A Group Of Neurodegenerative Dementias, Initially Characterized By Frontotemporal Lobar Atrophy, That Have Overlapping Clinical Presentations And Pathologic Findings. Although The Pathogenesis Of Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia Remains Unknown, And The Neurotransmitter Changes In Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia Are Not Well Characterized, There Is Evidence For Decreased Cholinergic Receptor Binding In Several Cortical Regions And Decreased Serotonin Binding In The Hypothalamus, Frontal Cortex, And Temporal Cortex. Galantamine Is A Reversible Cholinesterase Inhibitor. Recent Studies Indicate That Galantamine Is Also An Allosteric Modulator At Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptor Sites. This Nicotinic Modulation Appears To Not Only Potentiate The Response To Acetylcholine Binding, But Also To Modulate Release Of Several Other Neurotransmitters, Including Serotonin. This Pilot Study Will Explore The Safety And Tolerability And Efficacy Of Galantamine 8 Mg And 12 Mg Twice A Day Treatment In Subjects With Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia. The Study Comprises An 18 Week, Open Label, Galantamine Treatment Phase Followed By An 8 Week, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Withdrawal Phase. The Safety And Tolerability Of Galantamine Therapy Will Be Explored During Both The Open Label And Randomized Withdrawal Periods. The 8 Week Randomized Withdrawal Period Will Be Used To Confirm The Safety Of Galantamine Withdrawal In This Subject Group And Its Impact On Possible Symptom Improvement Achieved During The Open Label Period As A Marker For Efficacy. The Expectation Is That Subjects Who Remain On Galantamine For The Additional 8 Weeks Will Continue To Improve Or Will Remain Stable With Regard To Their Behavior, Language, Cognition, And Global Function, Whereas Subjects Who Are Assigned To Placebo Will Show A Decline In Some Of These Functions. This Approach Will Allow An Assessment Of The Effects Of Galantamine Treatment (Challenge) And Galantamine Withdrawal (De-Challenge). This Study Will Involve A Maximum Of 40 Subjects With Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia. Subjects Who Meet The Inclusion And Exclusion Criteria Will Receive Galantamine 4 Mg Twice A Day For 4 Weeks Followed By 8 Mg Twice A Day For 4 Weeks. At 8 Weeks, The Dose Of Galantamine Will Be Maintained At 8 Mg Or Increased To 12 Mg Twice A Day Based On Tolerability. At The End Of 12 Weeks The Dose Of Galantamine Will Be Maintained At 8 Or 12 Mg Twice A Day Or Reduced To 8 Mg Twice A Day, Based On Tolerability. The Dose Will Be Fixed For The Remainder Of The Open Label Treatment Period. Following 18 Weeks Of Galantamine Treatment, Subjects Will Be Randomly Assigned (1:1) To Continued Treatment With Galantamine (At The Same Dose) Or Placebo For An Additional 8 Weeks. Subjects And Caregivers Will Be Contacted By Phone During The Study And Encouraged To Contact The Site At Any Time If They Have Concerns. If The Subject'S Symptoms Appear To Be Substantially Worsening, And The Investigator Determines That The Subject Has Deteriorated, He Will Advise The Subject And Caregiver About Possible Early Completion Of The Study (Early Escape). Subjects Electing Early Escape Will Complete Final Efficacy And Safety Assessments, Then Discontinue Study Medication. Once They Have Completed The Study, They Will Begin The Treatment Of Their Choice In Consultation With Their Physician. Subjects Will Be Seen For Assessment At Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline), Visits 3 And 4 (12 And 18 Weeks After The Start Of Open Label Galantamine Treatment), And Visit 5 (8 Weeks After The Start Of The Double Blind Withdrawal Period Or At Early Escape) Or Upon Premature Discontinuation. The Subject And Caregiver Will Return For An Unscheduled Visit If, In The Judgment Of The Investigator, The Subject Requires Clinical Assessment Between Visits. Subject Selection Criteria Will Ensure Inclusion Of Subjects Who Have A Clinical Diagnosis Of Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia Established By Published Consensus Criteria And Supported By Neuroradiologic Confirmation. The Subjects Selected For The Study Will Have A Diagnosis Of Primary Progressive Aphasia Or Frontotemporal Dementia. Safety And Tolerability Will Be Monitored By Assessment Of Adverse Events, Electrocardiograms, Physical Examinations, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Weight, And Laboratory Tests. Efficacy On Symptoms Will Be Explored By Measuring Changes In The Frontal Behavioral Inventory (Fbi), The Aphasia Quotient (Aq) Of The Western Aphasia Battery (Wab), The Mini Mental State Examination (Mmse), The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (Mdrs), The Frontal Assessment Battery (Fab), The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Npi), The Alzheimer'S Disease Cooperative Study-Activities Of Daily Living (Adcs-Adl) Scale, The Clinical Global Impressions (Cgi) Scales Of Severity Or Change, And Subscales Of The Wab And Fbi. Changes In The Results Of Neurologic Examinations Will Also Be Documented. The Descriptive Analyses Will Be Performed, No Hypotheses Are Specified For Statistical Testing. Safety And Efficacy Assessments Will Be Summarized. Safety And Efficacy Changes Will Be Calculated From The Screening/Baseline Of The Galantamine Treatment Period To Week 18 (Open Label Galantamine Treatment Period) And Week 26 (Entire Study For Subjects Randomized To Galantamine For The 8 Week Withdrawal Period). Comparisons Between The Placebo And Galantamine Treatment Groups Will Use The Changes In Safety And Efficacy Parameters From Weeks 18 To 26 (The Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Period). Using A Flexible Dosing Regimen, Subjects Will Receive Galantamine As Oral Tablets Up To 8 Or 12 Mg Twice Per Day For 18 Weeks. Subjects Will Then Be Randomly Assigned (1:1) In A Double Blind Fashion To Galantamine At The Same Dose Or To Placebo For An Additional 8 Weeks Of Treatment.","Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment",Ii,Registry Only,0,0,1,1,2,2.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,4,15,1,0,0,0,20,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Cyclo???, An Experimental Treatment For People With Niemann Pick Disease Type C (Npc-1) Is Safe At 2 Different Dose Levels And What Effects It Has On People Who Have This Condition. Npc-1 Is Caused By A Defect In The Protein Which Is Important For The Transport Of Fatty Substances Like Cholesterol Out Of Cells. Without This Protein, Fats Build Up In The Cells Ultimately Leading To Organ Damage. The Way In Which This Experimental Treatment Works Is Not Fully Understood But Laboratory Experiments Have Shown That It Can Potentially Remove Cholesterol Build Up From The Cells In People Who Have Npc-1. Approximately 12 Patients Will Be Asked To Take Part In This Research Study For Up To 20 Weeks (W) In Total (Including Screening. Treatment And Follow-Up). Recruitment Is Expected To Take 6- 9 Months.Patients Who Take Part Will Receive Treatment By An Intravenous Infusion Every Two Weeks. The Study Will Look At What The Body Does To The Drug As Well As What The Drug Does To The Body By Taking And Examining Blood And Urine Samples. A Sample(S) Of Cerebrospinal Fluid (Csf) Will Be Taken By Lumbar Puncture During The First Treatment Dose And May Be Collected During Subsequent Doses.

Patients Will Also Have Their Hearing Tested, Be Asked Questions By Their Doctor As Well Completing Questionnaires To Help Assess Any Changes In Their Condition During Treatment.This Study Is Being Sponsored And Funded By Ctd Holdings Inc. It Is Planned To Be Run In The Usa,. Detailed Description: The Planned Study Has Been Designed As A Phase I, Double-Blind, Randomised, Multi-Centre, Parallel Group Study Based On Information And Data Available From The Administration Of Trappsol Cyclo Via Compassionate/Named Patient Use In Patients With Npc-1, And Data On Other Cyclodextrin Products In The Scientific Literature. The Primary Objective Is To Compare The Plasma Pharmacokinetics Of Single And Multiple Doses Of Two Different Levels Of Iv Trappsol Cyclo. Secondary Objectives Include Investigation Of The Hp-??-Cd Effect Of Different Doses Of Iv Trappsol Cyclo Upon Serum And Lymphocytic Markers Of Cholesterol Metabolism And Evaluation Of Trappsol Concentrations In The Cerebrospinal Fluid (Csf) Following Iv Administration , Evaluation Of The Impact Of Treatment Upon Measures Of Neurological Function Including Ataxia, Aphasia And Saccadic Eye Movements, And The Impact Of Treatment Upon Behavioral Aspects Of Npc-1. It Is Planned To Recruit A Total Of 12 Patients To The Study. Patients Will Be Randomised 1:1 To One Of The Two Dose Levels (1500 Mg/Kg Or 2500 Mg/Kg; Six Patients Per Dose Level). Treatment Will Be Administered Every Two Weeks By Slow Iv Infusion Over 8 To 9 Hours At Different Concentrations To Achieve The Proscribed Dose Levels. Patients Will Receive Treatment For A Total Of 12 Weeks. Patients Who Withdraw Prior To Completion Of The Initial Pharmacokinetic And Pharmacodynamic Assessments Will Be Replaced. The Design Of The Proposed Study Thus Enables Early Assessment Of Potential Biochemical Markers Of Response But Allows For A Sufficient Dosing Duration To Enable The Short-Term Effectiveness Of Trappsol In Npc To Be Assessed. The Maximum Dose Proposed For This Study Is Below The Maximum Dose For Which Long Term Clinical Data Is Available In 2 Patients (2800 Mg/Kg Weekly For 3-5 Years). Although Individual Clinicians Have Not Always Utilized An Escalating Rate Of Infusion, The Reports Of Infusion Related Reactions In Three Patients Suggest That This Is An Appropriate Clinical Strategy To Mitigate The Risk Of Such Events And Is Consistent With Dosing Administration For Other Therapeutic Agents. In The Proposed Study, Treatment Will Be Administered Less Frequently Than Has Been Undertaken In Compassionate Use. This Longer Dosing Interval Is Supported By Nonclinical Data Comparing The Metabolism Of Cholesterol In Non-Human Species With That In Man; Although A Once Weekly Dosing Interval Was Initially Studied In Man Based On Data In The Mouse, Hp-??-Cd Cholesterol Metabolism/Turnover In The Mouse Is 13-Fold Higher Than In Man Which, In Npc, Likely Translates Into A 13-Fold Slower Accumulation Of Cholesterol In Human Cells Compared With Those Of The Mouse. Therefore, It Is Theorized That, Given The Slower Cholesterol Metabolism In Humans, The Dosing Interval Could Be Much Less Frequent In Man Than In Mouse; However, Based On What Is Known About Cholesterol Metabolism In Humans And The Pharmacokinetic And Pharmacodynamic Effect Of Hp-??-Cd In The Mouse, A Dosing Interval Of 2 Weeks In Man Is Likely To Be Well Within The Therapeutic Dosing Interval And Also Minimizes The Amount Of Infusions Required To Be Administered. Pharmacodynamic Assessments Included Biomarkers Of Systemic Cholesterol Synthesis (Serum Lathosterol) And Degradation (Serum 4Β-Hydroxycholesterol), Secondary Sphingomyelin Storage (Plasma Lysosphingomyelin-509, Now More Accurately Referred To As N-Palmitoyl-O-Phosphocholineserine [Ppcs]), And Cns-Specific Biomarkers Of Neurodegeneration (Csf Total Tau) And Cholesterol Metabolism (Serum 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol [24(S)-Hc]).

The Design Of The Proposed Study Thus Enables Early Assessment Of Biochemical Markers Of Response But Allows For A Sufficient Dosing Duration To Enable The Effectiveness Of Trappsol In Npc-1 To Be Assessed. As Miglustat Is An Approved Treatment For Npc-1 In The Eu, With An Established Efficacy And Safety Profile, It Would Be Unethical To Exclude Patients Receiving Miglustat Therapy From The Study, Given That The Study Itself Will Also Be Conducted At Sites In Europe. However, It Is Planned To Balance Randomisation Across The Treatment Groups For Its Use. The Maximum Dose Proposed For This Study Is Below The Maximum Dose For Which Long Term Clinical Data Is Available In 2 Patients (2800 Mg/Kg Weekly For 3-5 Years).

These Cognitive Functions Are Thought To Be Critical For Appropriate Social Behavioural Regulation (Blair, 2003). Recent Studies In Animal Models And Humans Suggest That The Neuropeptide Oxytocin Is An Important Mediator Of Social Behavior And That Oxytocin May Facilitate Emotion Recognition, Theory Of Mind Processing, And Prosocial Behaviors (Donaldson And Young, 2008). Together, These Findings Suggest That Upregulation Of Oxytocin Dependent Mechanisms Of Social And Emotional Cognition May Be A Valuable Treatment Approach In Patients With Ftd. The Aim Of This Study Is To Determine How Administration Of Intranasal Oxytocin To Patients With Frontotemporal Dementia Affects Behavior And Processing Of Specific Types Of Social And Emotional Information.The Investigators' Hypothesis Is That Oxytocin Administration Will Improve Emotional And Social Cognitive Deficits In Patients With Ftd, Resulting In Improved Decision Making And Behaviour.","Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Crossover Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Caregiver, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor), Primary Purpose: Treatment",(N/A),Registry Only,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Sleeping Aids Like Benzodiazepines And Other Sedatives (E.G., Zolpidem, Zopiclone) Have Been Widely Used To Help Treat Insomnia. However, Sleeping Aids Are Also Known To Cause Adverse Drug Reactions Such As Drowsiness And Dizziness, That Increases The Risk Of Falls, Driving Impairment, Visual Impairment, Cognitive Impairment, And Upon Discontinuation May Cause Paradoxical Rebound Insomnia, Delirium, And Nightmares All Of Which Exacerbate The Initial Insomnia. All Of The Negative Aspects Of Sleeping Aid Use Are Exaggerated For Older, Frail Adults. Some Patients Experience An Early (Young-Age) Onset Dementia With A Substantial Component Of Insomnia. Due To The Many Risks Associated With Traditional Sleeping Aids They Are Often Inappropriate In Adults Living With Cognitive Impairment And/Or Frailty. Lemborexant Comes From A New Class Of Medications For Insomnia. Lemborexant Is A Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist That Blocks The Binding Of Wake-Promoting Neuropeptides Orexin A And Orexin B To Their Receptors Orexin 1 Receptor (Ox1R) And Orexin 2 Receptor (Ox2R), Which Is Thought To Suppress Wake Drive. Unlike Other Traditional Sleeping Aids, Lemborexant Has Not Shown To Be Significantly Associated With Driving Impairment, Rebound Insomnia, Or Dependence/Withdrawal Symptoms. Also, In Clinical Trials It Only Rarely Causes The Types Of Adverse Events Associated With Benzodiazepines And Other Traditional Sedatives And Is Less Often Associated With Discontinuations Due To Adverse Events. While Lemborexant Is Available On The Canadian Market It Is Unclear How This Medication Will Be Tolerated By Patients Living With An Early Onset Dementia. Understanding The Effectiveness And Tolerability Of Lemborexant Will Be Helpful In An N Of 1 Trial To Understand The Details Of Effect And Effectiveness In Individual Patients.","Allocation : N/A Intervention Model : Single Group Assignment Intervention Model Description : The Study Will Be An N Of 1 Trial Over 8 Weeks Were Treatment With Lemborexant Given Alternated With A Placebo In An ""Abbabaab"" Format.

Detailed Description: Background: Frontotemporal Dementia (Ftd) Is The First Cause Of Dementia In The Presenium (Onset Before The Age Of 65 Years). Characterized By Behavioral Disorders, It Is Often More Incapacitating Than Alzheimer'S Disease (Ad), And Leads To Death Within 7 Years On Average (9-10 Years For Ad). It Affects Young Individuals (On Average, 20 Years Younger Than In Ad), Who Are Often Still Active. Management Of These Patients Is Therefore Burdensome And Complex. As Opposed To Ad, However, No Treatment Is Currently Available. Few Therapeutic Trials Have Actually Been Conducted On This Disorder. Many Reasons May Account For This: 1. Recent Availability Of Reliable Diagnostic Criteria (The Lund And Manchester Groups' Consensus Statement In 1994; Revised In 1998), 2. The Very Small Number Of Cases As Opposed To Ad???The Number Of Cases Was Estimated At Approximately 3,500 Vs 600,000, For Ad, In France In 2004???, Ftd Therefore Falls Into The Category Of Rare Diseases (I.E., Less Than 30,000 Cases), 3. The Scarcity Of Valuable Physiopathological Hypotheses. Besides A Non-Specific Serotoninergic Dysfunction, No Significant Anomalies Related To Particular Neuromediators Have Apparently Been Found (As Opposed To Ad, Which Is Characterized By A Cholinergic Deficit). In 1998, The Discovery Of Mutations In The Tau Gene In Certain Kindreds Showing A Dominant Autosomal Transmission Of Ftd, Oriented Research Efforts Toward The Tau Protein And Provided New Perspectives. Many Studies Have Suggested The Role Of Excitotoxicity. Abnormal Aggregation Of The Tau Protein Has Been Observed In The Brains Of A Majority Of Ftd Patients (Familial And Sporadic Form). Excitotoxicity May Be Responsible For Promoting This Abnormal Aggregation Through Modification Of The Expression And Phosphorylation State Of The Tau Protein. The Hypothesis Of This Study Is That An Anti-Excitotoxic Neuroprotective Treatment May Slow The Pathogenic Process And Therefore Be An Effective Treatment For This Pathology. Goals: To Assess The Efficacy And Tolerability Of Memantine (Anti-Excitotoxic, Neuroprotective Treatment Currently Used In Ad) In Ftd Patients After A One-Year Treatment. Type Of Study: National, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Placebo-Controlled, Phase Ii Therapeutic Trial. Study Design: Sixty Four (64) Patients, Aged 45 To 75 Years, Will Be Enrolled In The Study For A Period Of 12 Months (Clinical Inclusion Criteria Are Defined Based On The Lund And Manchester Group Consensus Statement [Revised Version 1998]), And Followed Up For 1 Year In A Controlled Study. At The Time Of Inclusion, The Mini Mental Status Examination (Mmse) Score Should Be At Least 19 (Below 18, A Neuropsychological Examination Is Impossible). Patients Will Either Take Memantine, Or A Placebo (Randomization Ratio Of 1:1) Twice A Day (I.E., 20 Mg Of Memantine Per Day In The Memantine Arm). The Primary Efficacy Variable Will Be A Global Assessment Tool, The Cibic-Plus (Clinician'S Interview-Based Impression Of Change Plus Caregiver Input). Secondary Efficacy Variables Will Include Behavioral Scales [The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Npi), The Frontal Behavior Inventory (Fbi)], Cognitive Scales [The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (Mdrs), The Mmse], Activities Of Daily Living (Disability Assessment For Dementia, Dad), Time Spent By The Caregiver Of The Patient (Resource Utilization In Dementia, Rud), And Caregiver Burden Scale (Zarit Burden Inventory), And Tolerability Of The Drug. The Main Analysis Will Be Carried Out On An Intention-To-Treat Basis In All Randomized Patients Having Undergone At Least One Evaluation After Inclusion (The Last Observation Carried Forward Locf Value, Will Be Attributed To Missing Values). This Analysis Will Be Carried Out At The End Of The Double-Blind Study (Main Judgement Criterion) Expected Results And Perspectives: The Main Expected Result Is The Confirmation Of The Efficacy Of Memantine As A Treatment For Ftd, Which Would Set A Precedent In The Treatment Of This Disease. Such A Result Could Also Lead The Way To The Development Of Treatments For Other Related Neurodegenerative Disorders (Tauopathies) Such As The Other Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations (Semantic Dementia, Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Or Corticobasal Degeneration. Finally, The Standardized Follow-Up Of A 64 Patient Cohort In This Study Will Provide Important Information On The Natural History Of A Rare And Poorly-Known Disease.","Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Investigator), Primary Purpose: Treatment",Ii,Registry Only,0,0,1,1,2,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,3,0,0,0,4,FUNCTIONAL,0,0,0,0

Detailed Description: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Als) Is A Rapidly Evolving, Fatal Neurodegenerative Disease Resulting From The Degeneration Of Cortical, Bulbar And Spinal Motor Neurons. The Disease Progresses Inexorably To Death, Usually Because By Failure Of Respiratory Function, With A Median Duration Of 3 Years. Recent Clinical Trials Using Various Types Of Stem Cells, Including Mesenchymal Stromal Cells, Neural Stem Cells, And Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (Pbmcs), Represent Promising Strategies For Stem Cell-Based Treatment In Als. It Has Been Demonstrated That The Inflammation And Neuronal Death Were Reduced In Als Patients After Bone Marrow Transplantation. In Addition, The Incidence Of Immune Response Was Decreased By Autologous Transplantation Of Bone Marrow Cells In Als Patients. Pbmcs Are Multi-Potent Stem Cells That Are Very Attractive For A Cell Therapy Approach In Als Because Of Their Plasticity And Ability To Provide The Host Tissue With Growth Factors Or Modulate The Host Immune System. Pbmcs Were Used Clinically And Few Adverse Effects Were Attributed To Their Administration. Early Clinical Investigations Indicated That The Transplantation Of Autologous Pbmcs Into The Dura Is Feasible In Als Patients; However, One Study Was Limited To Three Patients And The Other Recruited Eight Patients. There Are Still Many Questions Regarding The Intrathecal Transplantation Of Pbmcs For Als. Therefore, A Retrospective Study Was Performed To Assess Further The Safety And Efficacy Of The Procedure And To Test The Impact Of A Cell Therapy Approach In Als Patients. Statistical Analysis Data, Expressed As The Mean ?? Sd, Were Analyzed Using Spss Version 17.0 For Windows (Spss Inc., Chicago, Il, Usa). Statistical Analyses Were Performed By Paired Sample T-Test.
