Klein, Jonathan Katz, Robert Baloh, Kimberly Goslin, Richard Lewis, Dallas Forshew, Peggy Allred, Arlena Cummings, Robert G. Miller Results from the EPI-589 Safety and Pharmacology Trial in ALS Patients Interim Results: A total of 21 subjects were enrolled in the trial; 17 subjects completed the 90-day treatment period. There were no drug-related serious adverse events or doselimiting toxicities recorded during the trial. The drug demonstrated predictable pharmacology. Of the 17 subjects that completed the treatment period, 6 of 17 demonstrated improvement or no change in ALS-FRS from baseline to the end of month 3; 8 of 17 demonstrated less than 1 point/ month worsening on the ALS-FRS. Analysis of biomarkers and remaining clinical endpoints is ongoing at this time and will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: EPI-589 is a novel small molecule that targets oxidoreductase enzymes critical to regulation of inflammation, oxidative stress and energy metabolism. In this clinical trial, EPI-589 was found to be safe and well-tolerated as well as to have predictable pharmacology. While additional results are still being analyzed, these safety data along with preclinical data, support the further development of EPI-589 for ALS.
