Klein, Jonathan Katz, Robert Baloh, Kimberly Goslin, Richard Lewis, Dallas Forshew, Peggy Allred, Arlena Cummings, Robert G. Miller Results from the EPI-589 Safety and Pharmacology Trial in ALS Patients Interim Results: A total of 21 subjects were enrolled in the trial; 17 subjects completed the 90-day treatment period. There were no drug-related serious adverse events or doselimiting toxicities recorded during the trial. The drug demonstrated predictable pharmacology. Of the 17 subjects that completed the treatment period, 6 of 17 demonstrated improvement or no change in ALS-FRS from baseline to the end of month 3; 8 of 17 demonstrated less than 1 point/ month worsening on the ALS-FRS. Analysis of biomarkers and remaining clinical endpoints is ongoing at this time and will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: EPI-589 is a novel small molecule that targets oxidoreductase enzymes critical to regulation of inflammation, oxidative stress and energy metabolism. In this clinical trial, EPI-589 was found to be safe and well-tolerated as well as to have predictable pharmacology. While additional results are still being analyzed, these safety data along with preclinical data, support the further development of EPI-589 for ALS.

Safety and tolerability of Triumeq in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: the Lighthouse trial. Results: 40 patients with ALS received Triumeq and 35 (88%) completed treatment. There were no drug-related serious adverse events; one patient was withdrawn from the study due to a drug-associated increase in liver enzymes. A favorable response on HERV-K expression levels was observed, accompanied by a decline in ALSFRS-R progression rate of 21.8% (95% CI -4.8%-48.6%) and the amount of urinary p75ECD measured. One patient died five months after stopping treatment, while five were expected to have died during the treatment period (interquartile range 2-8). Conclusions: Long-term Triumeq exposure was safe and well tolerated in this cohort. There was suggestive indication for a possible biological response in some pharmacodynamic and clinical biomarkers. A larger international phase 3 trial will be deployed to assess the effect of Triumeq on overall survival and disease progression. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284774 (Full Text Available at Source URL) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2019.1632899; November 7, 2017 [Interim Results] Amyotrophic and Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 18, S2, Pages 1-337, Published online: 7 Nov 2017 Presented at the 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2017, Boston, MA Abstract No. CLT-21 J Gold, D Rowe, S Vucic, S Mathers, MC Kiernan; Phase 2 safety and tolerability clinical trial of the combination antiretroviral therapy, Triumeq, in MND/ALS: the Lighthouse project Interim Results: 42 patients were screened and 40 were enrolled. Thirty-eight patients are currently in the treatment phase, with the majority completing within 4 months. Their mean age is 55.4 years (range = 32-73) with 52.3% < or = 55 years old. 64% Male and 36% Female. 41% were probable and 59% were definite ALS. The mean time since diagnosis was 1.1 years, with a range of 2 months to 1.7 years. So far there have been no direct treatment-related SAEs and tolerability appears to be good. It is anticipated to have a preliminary analysis of both the primary outcomes and an indication of the secondary outcomes by late 2017. Discussion: This is the first clinical trial to investigate HERVs as a possible aetiology of ALS. As it is an openlabel trial, any efficacy results will need to be interpreted with recognised precautions and these data will be analysed with carefully matched historical controls to determine possible biological signals.

Grossini, D. Garwhal, S. Venkatesan, A. Mele, M. Saraceno, A. Scognamiglio, F. De Marchi and L. Mazzini Role of the neurovascular unit and of the redox state in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis: modulatory effects elicited by acetyl-L-carnitine Results: At T0 we found an increase in TBARS and a reduction of GSH and of NO in plasma of ALS patients. In vitro, an increase of mitoROS and a decrease of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were found in both HUVEC and astrocytes treated with plasma of ALS patients. In HUVEC, NO release was reduced, as well. At T1, plasma TBARS levels were reduced whereas those of GSH were increased. In addition, an improvement of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by a reduction of mitoROS in HUVEC and astrocytes was observed. The results have been confirmed at T2. No statistically significant correlations were found with the genotype and phenotype characteristics of the patients. Discussion: The results obtained confirm the central role exerted by oxidative stress in ALS and suggest that unknown plasma factors may cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which is, in turn, capable of inducing an increased oxidants release and reduction of cell viability of NVU members. Al those events can be modulated by ALCAR.

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of acetyl-L-carnitine for ALS. Results: Analysis was made in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) population, completers and completers/compliers (i.e. taking > 75% of study drug). Forty-two patients received ALC and 40 placebo. In the ITT population, 34 (80.9%) patients receiving ALC and 39 (97.5%) receiving placebo became non-self-sufficient (p = 0.0296). In the PP analysis, percentages were 84.4 and 100.0% (p = 0.0538), respectively. Mean ALSFRS-R scores at 48 weeks were 33.6 (SD 10.4) and 27.6 (9.9) (p = 0.0388), respectively, and mean FVC scores 90.3 (32.6) and 58.6 (31.2) (p = 0.0158), respectively. Median survival was 45 months (ALC) and 22 months (placebo) (p = 0.0176). MRC, QoL and adverse events were similar. Conclusion: In conclusion, ALC may be effective, well-tolerated and safe in ALS. A pivotal phase III trial is needed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23421600 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/21678421.2013.764568; April 25, 2012 Presented at the 64th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 21-28, 2012, New Orleans, LA Abstract no: P04.151 Ettore Beghi Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial on the Use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: 42 patients received ALC and 40 patients placebo. In the ITT population, 34 patients receiving ALC (80.9%) and 39 receiving placebo (97.5%) became non self-supporting (p=0.030). Percentages in study completers were 71.4 vs. 94.7% (p=0.064) and in “completers/compliers”, 71.4% vs. 94.4% (p=0.069).

SIMONE 10, LUCIO TREMOLIZZO 16 AND THE ITALIAN ALS STUDY GROUP Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of acetyl-L-carnitine for ALS Results The trial was conducted in 16 experimental centres that enrolled and assigned participants to interventions. With only one exception (a patient with a serious adverse event), all investigators remained blind to treatment assignment throughout the study. Given the slow recruitment rate, after approval by the DMC, one interim analysis was performed in 46 patients (23 in each arm). The results on the primary endpoint did not show any difference ( p 0.76); however, a trend favouring active treatment was observed for the ALSFRS-R and for the MRC scores (data not shown) and led the investigators to complete the recruitment as established by the protocol. Between 1 March 2007 and 9 February 2010, 82 patients were enrolled; 42 received ALC and 40 placebo. The sample comprised 50 males and 32 females, aged 38 – 74 years. Sixty patients had spinalonset and 22 bulbar-onset ALS. Age, gender, site of onset, disease duration, general examination, comorbidity, BMI, mean ALSFRS-R, MRC, FVC and McGill scores were equally distributed in the two arms (Table I). The numbers of patients at each follow-up visit are depicted in Figure 1. Two patients (one in each arm) were later found not to have ALS. They had inclusion bodies myositis (placebo) and Kennedy syndrome (ALC). Other protocol violations included being non-self-suffi cient at baseline (ALC, 5; placebo, 7), age younger than 40 years or older than 70 years (ALC, 4; placebo, 2), and FVC 80% (placebo, 1). In one patient aged less than 40 years, disease duration exceeded 24 months. None received incorrect study treatment or doses or experimental medications. Conclusion: we are still uncertain whether the results of this study are suffi cient to support a claim of effi cacy for ALC. However, our data cannot be interpreted solely as chance fi ndings. Given the paucity of effective treatments, this trial should not be discarded but considered the scientifi c background for a confi rmatory trial. https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/rest/download/result/attachment/2004-004158-23/1/25774",,3303 EudraCT Number: 2004-004158-23 FARM5LRKR9 TrialTroveID-109501,The first end-point and 'the proportion of cases that become incapacitated during the period of 12 months of treatment.,"Accessed for eligibility: 80 Randomized: 82 Acetyl-L-carnitine: Allocated: 42 Received: 42 Lost to follow-up and discontinued treatment: 14 0-4 weeks: Voluntary Withdrew- 1 4-12 weeks: Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 1, Adverse Event (AE)- 2 12-24 weeks: Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 1 24-36 weeks: Patients Died- 2, Adverse Event (AE)- 1, patients lost to follow-up- 1 36-48 weeks: patients lost to follow-up- 2, Patients Died- 1, Patients tracheostomised: 1, Adverse Event (AE)- 2 Analysis: Analysed (Per-protocol)- 32 Analysed (Completers and per-protocol)- 21 Patient later found not to have ALS: 1 Patients being non self supporting at baseline: 5 Patients younger than 40years and older than 70years: 4 Placebo: Allocated: 40 Received: 40 Lost to follow-up and discontinued treatment: 21 0-4 weeks: 0 4-12 weeks: Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 1, Adverse Event (AE)- 1 12-24 weeks: Patients Died- 3, Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 2, patients lost to follow-up- 1 24-36 weeks: Patients Died- 2, Patients tracheostomised: 1, Adverse Event (AE)- 1, Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 1 36-48 weeks: Adverse Event (AE)- 3, Patients lost to follow-up- 2,Voluntary Withdrew(VW)- 2, Patients Died- 1 Analysis: Analysed (Per-protocol)- 29 Analysed (Completers and per-protocol)- 13 Patient later found not to have ALS: 1 Patients being non self supporting at baseline: 7 Patients younger than 40years and older than 70years: 2 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/rest/download/result/attachment/2004-004158-23/1/25774",,109501,,,,Ii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

The average improvement in the SARA score with NALL was superior to Placebo [95% CI -1.94, -0.69, p<0.001]. The secondary endpoints (CGI, SCAFI, mDRS) were also improved with IB1001 as compared to placebo (p<0.001). The frequency of adverse events (36 patients, 79 events when receiving NALL vs 30 patients, 75 events when receiving placebo) were similar between the two groups. No treatment-related serious adverse events or deaths occurred. Conclusion NALL demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over placebo with a clinically meaningful benefit in symptoms (motor and cognitive), functioning, cognition, and quality of life. NALL was safe and well-tolerated, providing a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of NPC. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2024/PDFfiles/AAN2024-003585.html; February 01, 2024 N Engl J Med. 2024 Feb 1;390(5):421-431.

Martakis Trial of N-Acetyl-l-Leucine in Niemann-Pick Disease Type C Results: A total of 60 patients 5 to 67 years of age were enrolled. The mean baseline SARA total scores used in the primary analysis were 15.88 before receipt of the first dose of NALL (60 patients) and 15.68 before receipt of the first dose of placebo (59 patients; 1 patient never received placebo). The mean (±SD) change from baseline in the SARA total score was -1.97±2.43 points after 12 weeks of receiving NALL and -0.60±2.39 points after 12 weeks of receiving placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.28 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.91 to -0.65; P<0.001). The results for the secondary end points were generally supportive of the findings in the primary analysis, but these were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar with NALL and placebo, and no treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: Among patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, treatment with NALL for 12 weeks led to better neurologic status than placebo. A longer period is needed to determine the long-term effects of this agent in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38294974/ https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2310151/suppl_file/nejmoa2310151_research-summary.pdf [Full text available at:] https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2310151?articleTools=true; June 29, 2023 [Press release] INTRABIO ANNOUNCES POSITIVE PIVOTAL TRIAL RESULTS OF IB1001 FOR THE TREATMENT OF NIEMANN-PICK DISEASE TYPE C - Phase 3 trial met the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints showing high statistical significance - IB1001 showed a clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and cognition in both pediatric and adult patients with NPC - IB1001 was safe and well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile consistent with previous clinical and pre-clinical studies - Based on these positive results, IntraBio plans to file for marketing authorization with IB1001 with the FDA and EMA June 29, 2023, 8:00 AM EDT IntraBio Inc today announced positive topline results from the pivotal, Phase III IB1001-301 clinical trial (NCT05163288), showing IB1001 significantly improved symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and cognition in pediatric and adult patients with Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC). The primary endpoint of the trial evaluated the impact of IB1001 on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) compared to placebo after 12 weeks. Treatment with IB1001 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 1.37-point reduction of the SARA score compared to placebo (-1.97 on IB1001 vs. -0.60 on placebo; p<0.001). The trial also met its secondary endpoints, the modified Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (mSARA) (-1.66 on IB1001 vs. on -0.67 placebo; p<0.001) and the Investigator’s Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) (-0.7 on IB1001 vs. +0.1 on placebo; p<0.001). IB1001 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events, consistent with its established, benign safety profile. The positive IB1001-301 results are consistent with the Phase IIb multinational clinical trial previously completed with IB1001 for NPC (IB1001-201 – NCT03759639), which also showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement on the SARA, mSARA, and Investigator’s CGI-I endpoints and a benign safety profile. Based on these positive trials, IntraBio will proceed with global regulatory submissions to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other global regulators. “This is a critical breakthrough for the NPC patient community,” said Dr. Marc Patterson, Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics, and Medical Genetics at Mayo Clinic. “...The trial of IB1001 shows clinically meaningful effects at a high level of statistical significance in patients with NPC. There is currently no approved therapy for NPC in the US, and given this convincing evidence of efficacy coupled with the very benign safety profile, I am hopeful that IB1001 will be rapidly approved, to ensure that every NPC patient will be able to access safe and effective treatment for this devastating disease.” The National Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation’s Executive Director Joslyn Crowe commented: “We are optimistic IB1001 is quickly on track to be an approved treatment for NPC. The strong efficacy and safety results of the IB1001 clinical trial bring new levels of hope to patients and families affected by NPC. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with IntraBio to help ensure IB1001 is made available for all patients in our community given their urgent need for effective, approved treatments.”... http://intrabio.com/2023/06/29/intrabio-announces-positive-pivotal-trial-results-of-ib1001-for-the-treatment-of-niemann-pick-disease-type-c/; May 23, 2023 [Interim Results] Acetyl-L-Leucine for Niemann-Pick type C: A Multinational Double-blind Randomized Placebo-controlled Crossover Study Tatiana Bremova-Ertl, Taylor Fields, Kyriakos Martakis, Michael Strupp Results: The clinical trial has been initiated in July 2022. Twenty-one patients have been screened, 15 patients have been recruited. Approximately 53 patients will be enrolled, 46 patients will be analyzed according to the Intention to Treat (ITT). Conclusions: Given the lack of global symptomatic or disease-modifying therapies for NPC and other lysosomal diseases there is an urgent need for effective and well-tolerated drug treatments.

IB1001 demonstrated a statistically significant and clear clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life for pediatric and adult patients with NPC. Treatment with IB1001 resulted in a statistically significant change in the Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) (90% CI: 0.25, 1.75, p-value = 0.029) assessed by blinded, independent raters. The trial also met its secondary endpoints, including the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), Investigator’s Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) demonstrating both a statistically significant change during treatment (clinical improvement; SARA 90% CI: -1.8, -0.5, p=0.001; CGI-C 90% CI: 3.0, 3.5, p <0.001) and during post-treatment washout (clinical deterioration; SARA 90% CI: 0.5, 2.0, p=0.002; CGI-C 90% CI: 4.0, 5.0, p=0.006). There was no meaningful difference in these endpoints detected between the baseline and washout period, bolstering the statistical significance and clinically meaningful effect of IB1001 established by the primary and secondary endpoints. Subgroup analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints demonstrates consistent clinical effects across all demographics (age, gender, disease severity, age of symptom onset, etc.). This positive data provide a strong rationale for IB1001 to be used in the treatment of all patients with NPC.

The scores of these 3 were transformed to Z-scores (=individual's average of both trials to perform the respective task - mean of study population at baseline) / SD of study population at baseline). A Z-score of 0 equates to the population mean at baseline. For all 3, higher Z-scores (above mean) mean better performance. The SCAFI total score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the non-missing Z-scores for the 3. A higher total score means better performance.

Multiple micro-RNAs previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS, together with several candidate neuropeptides and pNFH change, were determined and related to clinical outcome. The results were compared to normal, no neurological disease, controls (n 10) and patients from a phase II secondary progressive MS double- blind clinical trial (n 20) who were treated with HICS. The groups acted as controls to elucidate whether a definable prognostic marker could be identified specific to the ALS cohort. These studies together with results from two independent SOD1 G93A mouse studies using HICS have allowed progress in the development of a rationale for further work in cadaveric human brain tissue taken from ALS patients where the various studies have allowed us to focus on mechanisms of neurotoxicity in ALS. The results of which will be available in Q4 of this year. Discussion: HICS showed efficacy in humans with ALS with no safety concerns or adverse event recorded. This confirmed the safety profile of the drug once again as seen in two separate phase II clinical trials recently completed. The results of the open-label study in ALS are certainly encouraging but will need to be confirmed in a randomised placebo-control trial in the future.

Bensimon, and P.N. Leigh ; on behalf of the MIROCALS Study Group Modifying immune response and outcomes in ALS (MIROCALS): design and results of a phase 2b, double-blind randomized placebocontrolled trial of low dose interleukin-2 (ld IL2) in ALS Results & conclusion: MIROCALS is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of low-dose IL2, delivered by sub-cutaneous injections (2MU) in 5-day cycles every 28 days, as in IMODALS. Volunteers with ALS (disease duration 24 months, VC 70%, not previously treated with riluzole, age 18–76, El Escorial Definite, Probable, Laboratory-Supported Probable, or Possible) were recruited to a 3-month ‘run-in’ while starting riluzole. Volunteers who tolerated riluzole were randomized to ld IL2 or a matching placebo. At selection and randomization, all volunteers were required to have blood and CSF sampling. A third CSF sample was collected at week 17 post-randomization. Blood sampling at other time points was taken for biomarker assays and for safety monitoring. 220 volunteers were randomized over 28 months in the UK (n¼ 83) and France (n¼ 137) in 17 ALS Centers. Treatment was continued for 18 months (548 days) but blinded follow-up and ascertainment of survival were maintained for all randomized volunteers until 21 months (640 days) after randomization. The Primary efficacy outcome was time to death (survival) at 21 months (640 days) post-randomization in the ITT population. Pre-specified survival analyses for treatment effect include stratified Log-rank and Cox proportional hazard models. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were: ALSFRS-R slope; SVC slope. Core biomarkers were CSF pNFH; CSF CCL2; and Tregs (number and percent of CD4 cells). EQol-5D was used to assess the quality of life.

Kirby Decoding gene regulatory networks in ALS ...The IMODALS clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT02059759) was a phase II study to assess the safety and activity and low dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL-2) in a small cohort of ALS patients (1). The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial tested two doses of IL-2, and blood samples were taken at five time-points during the trial for transcriptomic analysis. Our collaborators in the trial highlighted that there was a variable response amongst patients to the treatment, as measured by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and we demonstrated that this was due to differential expression of genes in the T-cell gene regulatory network (2). In addition, two potential biomarkers were identified in the baseline sample that predicted the patient’s response to treatment.

In this report, we describe the results of microarray gene expression profiling of trial participants' leukocyte population. We identified a dose-dependent increase in regulatory T-cell markers at the end of the treatment period. Longitudinal analysis revealed an alteration and inhibition of inflammatory pathways occurring promptly at the end of the first treatment cycle. These responses are less pronounced following the end of the third treatment cycle, although an activation of immune-regulatory pathways, involving regulatory T-cells and T helper 2 cells, was evident only after the last cycle. This indicates a cumulative effect of repeated low-dose interleukin-2 administration on regulatory T-cells. Our analysis suggested the existence of inter-individual variation amongst trial participants and we therefore classified patients into low, moderate and high-regulatory T-cell-responders. NanoString profiling revealed substantial baseline differences between participant immunological transcript expression profiles with the least responsive patients showing a more inflammatory-prone phenotype at the beginning of the trial. Finally, we identified two genes in which pre-treatment expression levels correlated with the magnitude of drug responsiveness. Therefore, we proposed a two-biomarker based regression model able to predict patient regulatory T-cell-response to low-dose interleukin-2. These findings and the application of this methodology could be particularly relevant for future precision medicine approaches to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34409288/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364666/; November 5, 2020 [Additional Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 21, Issue supplement 2, November 2020 Presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2020, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 5, 2020 Abstract No.: GEN-02 Ms Ilaria Giovannelli, Mr Marius Mickunas, Dr Timothy Tree, Prof Gilbert Bensimon, Prof Nigel Leigh, Dr Paul Heath, Prof Dame Pamela Shaw, Prof Janine Kirby Blood Transcriptomics of ALS Patients in the IMODALS Clinical Trial Findings: Blood transcriptome of these patients was analysed at day 8 (after the first treatment cycle), 64 (after the third and last cycle) and 85 (during follow-up) and changes over the treatment course and under different administration regimens were evaluated. Gene expression analysis together with pathway analysis revealed a prompt immune-regulatory effect of ld-IL-2 after the first treatment cycle with evidence of downregulation of pro-inflammatory processes. This early response seemed to diminish during the course of the trial but a robust activation of Treg was only visible after the last treatment cycle. In fact, a time-dependent and dose-dependent induction of Treg markers was registered at day 64 suggesting a cumulative effect of ld-IL-2 on these cells. However, inter-individual dissimilarities were identified and patients were classified into low, mild and high responders. Significant transcriptional differences were reported amongst these groups in their baseline expression of an immunological transcript cluster. In particular, a more inflammatory-prone phenotype was documented amongst low responders at recruitment. Finally, a predictive biomarker analysis was then carried out to identify small sets of transcripts able to forecast an ALS individual's reaction to ld-IL-2. We discovered that the expression of two genes was able to predict Treg count at the end of the trial, given their gene expression at time of recruitment.

No drug-related serious adverse event was observed. Non-serious adverse events occurred more frequently with the 1 and 2 MIU IL-2 doses compared to placebo, including injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Primary outcome analysis showed a significant increase (p < 0·0001) in %Tregs in the 2 MIU and 1 MIU arms (mean [SD]: 2 MIU: +6·2% [2·2]; 1 MIU: +3·9% [1·2]) as compared to placebo (mean [SD]: -0·49% [1·3]). Effect sizes (ES) were large in treated groups: 2 MIU ES=3·7 (IC95%: 2·3-4·9) and 1 MIU ES=3·5 (IC95%: 2·1-4·6). Secondary outcomes showed a significant increase in %Tregs following repeated cycles (p < 0·0001) as compared to placebo, and a dose-dependent decrease in plasma CCL2 (p = 0·0049). There were no significant differences amongst the three groups on plasma NFL levels. Conclusion: Ld-IL-2 is well tolerated and immunologically effective in subjects with ALS. These results warrant further investigation into their eventual therapeutic impact on slowing ALS disease progression. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32651161/ https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/ebiom/PIIS2352-3964(20)30219-X.pdf; March 3, 2017 Presented at the 69th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 22-28, 2017, Boston, MA.

Drugrelated NSAEs were similar to those reported in other conditions, and were generally mild to moderate and transient. Compared to placebo, both ld IL-2 doses significantly expanded Tregn and Treg% (p<0.00001, Kruskal Wallis test) at Temax-cycle/1 and Temax-cycle/3, and at all trough level times ( iAUCtrough p<0.0021 for Tregn, p<0.007 for Treg%). No deleterious after-effect was detected 3 months after last dosing. No significant changes was detected for the secondary criteria ALSFRS, SVC, or NFs. Conclusions: Ld IL-2 therapy is safe and well tolerated in ALS patients; our treatment schedule induced a strong expansion of Tregs at both doses, lasting throughout the treatment period. These preliminary results warrant further clinical developments to investigate whether ld IL-2 induced Tregs expansion translates into a clinical benefit for the ALS patients population. http://submissions.mirasmart.com/Verify/AAN2017/submission/temp/rad299CD.pdf To Access the abstract: 1.

Results: Infusions of expanded autologous Tregs with concomitant IL-2 injections were safe and well-tolerated in all three subjects during early and later phases of disease. The infusions increased Treg numbers in the peripheral blood and enhanced Treg suppressive function ex vivo. Disease progression rates were slowed during the time of infusions and correlated inversely with the improved Treg suppression. The patients progressed at differing rates following completion of the first four Treg infusions. Disease progression rates again slowed during the second four Treg infusions, despite the later stage of disease and decreased frequency of Treg infusions. An increase in Treg numbers and improved Treg suppressive function were also observed during the second four Treg infusions. Proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression levels were variably suppressed after Treg infusions. In addition, all three patients reported robust increases in fasciculations during the time of the Treg infusions. Initial MUNE measurements were low in each patient and did not change throughout the course of the study. Conclusions: Infusions of expanded autologous Tregs into ALS patients were safe and well-tolerated and slowed disease progression rates. Our results suggest the potential clinical value of repeated autologous infusions of Tregs in ALS.

ANNOUNCES PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATION OF PHASE 2A CLINICAL TRIAL DATA FOR COYA 101 IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) - Phase 2a publication entitled “Combined Regulatory T-Lymphocyte and IL-2 Treatment is Safe, Tolerable, and Biologically Active for One Year in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” has been published in peer-reviewed journal Neurology, Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation - COYA 101 was well tolerated and increased Treg suppressive function - The majority (6 out of 8) of patients either slowed or stopped progression (mean change of -2.7 points on ALSFRS-R score) during the open label extension over a 24-week period while 2 out of 8 patients did not benefit from treatment - Assessment of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress over the course of the study correlated with ALS disease severity and may serve to prospectively evaluate and/or monitor treatment response HOUSTON, Sept. 01, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coya Therapeutics, Inc. (“Coya”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multiple approaches that aim to enhance regulatory T cells (Tregs) function, including allogeneic Treg-derived exosome therapeutics and novel biologics, today announced the publication of the Phase 2a clinical trial data for its first-in-class Treg cell therapy product candidate, COYA 101. Coya has an exclusive worldwide license from Houston Methodist Hospital to develop, manufacture, and commercialize COYA 101. The article entitled “Combined Regulatory T-Lymphocyte and IL-2 Treatment is Safe, Tolerable, and Biologically Active for One Year in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” has been published online in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology, Neuroimmunology, & Neuroinflammation. Subjects enrolled in the Phase 2a trial were initially randomized into a double-blind portion to receive active Treg cells or matching placebo every four weeks over 24 weeks. After completion of the 24-week double-blind (DB) portion, subjects entered an open-label extension (OLE) during which all patients received active Treg cells every four weeks for additional 24 weeks. The DB portion of the trial was curtailed due to COVID-19-related restrictions, and the limited number of patients enrolled made statistical analysis not feasible. However, the eight patients included in the OLE completed the 24-week study, and 75% (n=6) of them exhibited slow to no progression as measured by the ALSFRS-R (mean decline of -2.7 points). A sub-analysis of these six patients showed that four of them (50% of the intention-to-treat [ITT] patient population, n=8) exhibited no decline over the 24-week treatment period. The two remaining patients in the OLE did not experience a treatment benefit. The Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) is a validated rating instrument that gauges the progression of disability in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on a 48-point scale. In addition to the benefit experienced by the majority of patients in clinical function, Treg suppressive function was higher following infusions, compared to baseline values at screening. An unbiased proteomics assay of the OLE specimens documented that the two rapidly progressing patients had markedly higher levels of biomarkers of inflammation (IL-17F and IL-17C) and oxidative stress (OLR1 and ox-LDL) compared to the other six patients who exhibited amelioration or halting of disease progression, representing important findings that may provide new tools to identify the most suitable ALS patients for the next well-powered and well controlled trial. Overall, treatment with COYA 101 was well tolerated. No deaths were reported and no patient receiving Treg infusions were discontinued from the study. Howard Berman, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Coya, stated, “We believe this Phase 2a study, with the limitations of a small sample size, supports that COYA 101 was well tolerated and biologically active in ALS patients and may slow or halt disease progression in the right patient population. We believe the findings that high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress may limit the effectiveness of Tregs, resulting in shorter cell half-lives and impacting their downstream suppressive anti-inflammatory effects, may help to better enhance the signal by prospectively identifying the patients with the higher likelihood to respond,” concluded Dr. Berman. “We are encouraged by the results from this study, which are consistent with the positive outcomes of the previous Phase 1 trial in ALS patients. We believe these results are relevant, as they provide information we need to design our next double-blind controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of COYA 101,” added Adrian Hepner, M.D, Ph.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of Coya. Stanley H. Appel, M.D., the Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of Coya, stated, “Although the double-blind portion of the Phase 2a study was compromised by COVID-19, we believe the Open Label Extension supports the findings of our Phase 1 study that COYA 101 infusions are well tolerated, may enhance suppressive functions and may have the potential to slow disease progression.” https://www.coyatherapeutics.com/news/10-press-release/124-oyaherapeuticsncnnounceseereviewedublication20220901063003.html; August 29, 2022 Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm. 2022 Nov; 9(6): e200019.

Appel, MD Combined Regulatory T-Lymphocyte and IL-2 Treatment Is Safe, Tolerable, and Biologically Active for 1 Year in Persons With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: The Treg/IL-2 treatments were safe and well tolerated, and Treg suppressive function was higher in the active group of the RCT. A meaningful evaluation of progression rates in the RCT between the placebo and active groups was not possible due to the limited number of enrolled participants aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 24-week OLE, the Treg/IL-2 treatments were also safe and well tolerated in 8 participants who completed the escalating doses. Treg suppressive function and numbers were increased compared with baseline. Six of 8 participants changed by an average of -2.7 points per the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, whereas the other 2 changed by an average of -10.5 points. Elevated levels of 2 markers of peripheral inflammation (IL-17C and IL-17F) and 2 markers of oxidative stress (oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 and oxidized LDL) were present in the 2 rapidly progressing participants but not in the slower progressing group. Discussion: Treg/IL-2 treatments were safe and well tolerated in the RCT and OLE with higher Treg suppressive function. During the OLE, 6 of 8 participants showed slow to no progression. The 2 of 8 rapid progressors had elevated markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, which may help delineate responsiveness to therapy. Whether Treg/IL-2 treatments can slow disease progression requires a larger clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04055623). Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that Treg infusions and IL-2 injections are safe and effective for patients with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36038262/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9423710/",Secondary Outcome Measures : Change in Treg numbers in the blood from baseline to week 24.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic limited the enrollment to 9 participants, 4 at HMH and 5 at MGH. Two participants' Tregs could not be expanded. One of these 2 received IL-2 briefly and was included in the safety analysis of AEs. Seven successfully began treatment in the RCT. Six of these participants successfully completed the RCT and OLE. One participant discontinued the study after receiving the second Treg or placebo infusion due to an SAE classified as an allergic reaction. At the study's conclusion, the participant was revealed as having been in the placebo group.

(“Coya”), a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company developing first-in-class approaches utilizing autologous regulatory T cells (Treg) and Treg-derived exosome therapeutics for neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, today announced the publication of results from a Phase 1 trial entitled “Tregs Attenuate Peripheral Oxidative Stress and Acute Phase Proteins in ALS.” The paper detailing the evaluation of critical biomarkers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress with the potential ability to select ALS patients exhibiting a greater chance of therapeutic response to Treg cell therapy (COYA 101) was published in the Annals of Neurology, an official journal of the American Neurological Association, and can be found here. ...Summary of Publication Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) cell therapy was assessed for suppression of oxidative stress (OS) and acute phase proteins (APP) responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of ex-vivo expanded Treg cell therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a six-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg cells administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg cell therapy has the potential to suppress peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring clinical efficacy of immunomodulating therapies. https://www.coyatherapeutics.com/news/10-press-release/110-coya-therapeutics-announces-annals-of-neurology-publication-featuring-biomarker-data-in-als-patients-treated-with-tregs-cell-therapy.html; April 20, 2022 Ann Neurol. 2022 Aug;92(2):195-200. doi: 10.1002/ana.26375.

Appel, MD Expanded autologous regulatory T-lymphocyte infusions in ALS: A phase I, first-in-human study Results Infusions of Tregs were safe and well tolerated in all patients. Treg numbers and suppressive function increased after each infusion. The infusions slowed progression rates during early and later stages of disease. Spearman correlation analyses showed that increased Treg suppressive function correlated with slowing of disease progression per the Appel ALS scale for each patient: patient 1: ρ (rho) = -0.60, p = 0.003; patient 2: ρ = -0.71, p = 0.0026; and patient 3: ρ = -0.54, p = 0.016. Measures of maximal inspiratory pressure also stabilized, particularly in 2 patients, during Treg infusions. Conclusions These results demonstrate the safety and potential benefit of expanded autologous Treg infusions, warranting further clinical trials in patients with ALS. The correlation between Treg suppressive function and disease progression underscores the significance of using Treg suppressive function as an indicator of clinical status. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845093 Full text Available: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961523/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961523/pdf/NEURIMMINFL2018016097.pdf; April 18, 2017 [Interim results] Neurology April 18, 2017 vol. 88 no. 16 Supplement P3.137 Poster Session III, Neuromuscular and Clinical Neurophysiology (EMG): Motor Neuron Disease I Jason Thonhoff, David Beers, Weihua Zhao, Luis Lay, Della Brown, James Berry, Merit Cudkowicz, Elizabeth Shpall, Katayoun Rezvani, Stanley Appel A Phase 1 Study Assessing the Infusion of Expanded Autologous Regulatory T Lymphocytes in Subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: Autologous Treg infusions and concomitant IL-2 injections were safe and well-tolerated in 3 subjects with ALS.

Each group is composed of individual tests. The total Appel ALS score is 30 for healthy subjects and 164 for those with maximum impairment. The rate of change in the Appel ALS Rating Scale is a significant predictor of survival for subjects with ALS. ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) [ Time Frame: Baseline to week 15 ] The ALSFRS-r (ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised) is an orally administered validated instrument using an ordinal rating scale used to determine the subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. The scale addresses fine motor, gross motor, bulbar and respiratory function. The ALSFRS-r is used as a clinical assessment in ALS standard of care and in most ALS clinical trials. T-Regulatory Cells [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 months post treatment for a total of two years from baseline ] Treg percentage (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells) within the total CD4+ population will be assessed by multicolor flow cytometry. Treg Suppression [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 months post treatment for a total of two years from baseline ] Treg suppressive function of T-effector (Teff) cells will be assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Correlation between changes in the rate of disease progression and the Treg percentage and function will be determined by Spearman's correlation analysis. TH17 and Th1 lymphocytes [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 months post-treatment for a total of two years from baseline ] The percentage of Tregs, Th1 lymphocytes and Th17 lymphocytes will be assessed by multicolor flow cytometry. Other Outcome Measures: Pulmonary FVC - Exploratory Measure [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 months post-treatment for a total of two years from baseline ] FVC (Forced Vital Capacity). Reduction of pulmonary function is the primary source of morbidity and mortality in ALS. FVC testing will be used to monitor respiratory function. FVC measures the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Pulmonary MIP - Exploratory Measure [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 months post-treatment for a total of two years from baseline ] MIP (Maximum Inspiratory Pressure. Reduction of pulmonary function is the primary source of morbidity and mortality in ALS. MIP testing will be used to monitor respiratory function. MIP measures inspiratory muscle strength.

In response to IL-2, 2755 differentially expressed genes (fc þ1.2/ 1.2 and FDR p-value (p < 0.05)) were identified at Wk2vsRDN, compared to 3706 differentially expressed genes at Wk18vsRDN. Overlapping ontology clusters relating to cell cycle, immune system and cytokines were identified at both timepoints. Following the same analysis criteria, no differen- tially expressed genes were observed within the placebo group from the comparable timepoints. Looking at key Treg genes, all four were increasingly expressed at both Wk2vsRDN (FOXP3 fc2.93, p3.24E-38; IL2RA fc4.75, p6.46E-39; CTLA4 fc2.38, p8.07E-27; IKZF2 fc2.19, p8.47E-18) and Wk18vsRDN (FOXP3 fc3.79, p1.40E-45; IL2RA fc7.23, p1.40E- 45; CTLA4 fc2.94, p3.15E-39; IKZF2 fc2.78, p8.03E-30). Conclusions: Very few studies have investigated the longitu- dinal effect of IL-2 and riluzole from point of diagnosis. By correlating the data generated with Treg levels and ALS bio- markers, such as pNFH and NFL, this will allow us to begin to examine the underlying basis for the response to IL-2. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; November 15, 2023 [Additional analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-17 Genetic status in clinical trials: the modifying immune responses and outcomes in ALS Study (MIROCALS) Results: Univariate analysis confirmed previous studies show- ing that C9orf72 expansion status is associated with worse prognosis (Exp(B) 1.76 (0.99–3.11), p ¼ 0.05) but not for UNC13A (p ¼ 0.44). The addition of C9orf72 expansion status to the multivariate model which included treatment and treatment x pNFH interaction, improved model fit (p ¼ 0.06) and was associated with worse survival (C9orf72 expansion p ¼ 0.045). There was no interaction of C9orf72 expansion status with treatment, and no improvement in model fit with UNC13A status. Conclusions: The treatment effect of ld IL2 is homogeneous across C9orf72 and UNC13A genotypes. Inclusion of geno- type status improves model fit in the analysis of clinical trials and should be considered for all trial analyses. Further geno- typic analyses are in progress. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; December 8, 2022 [Press Release] CLINIGEN NOTES RESULTS FROM THE MIROCALS TRIAL INVESTIGATING LOW DOSE PROLEUKIN® (ALDESLEUKIN) IN PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS -Clinigen Limited (‘Clinigen’), the global pharmaceutical services company, is pleased to note the announcement of top-line results from MIROCALS (Modifying Immune Response & OutComes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) a phase 2b randomised placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of low dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) for controlling neuro-inflammation in newly-diagnosed patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The MIROCALS trial, conducted in 220 patients from 17 clinics across the UK and France, in collaboration with eight leading research groups in the UK, France, Italy and Sweden, investigated whether low dose IL-2 can modify aspects of neuro- inflammation, which is believed to play a central role in ALS disease progression. Dr. Gilbert Bensimon presented the top-line results at the International Symposium on ALS / Motor Neuron Diseases. The unadjusted analysis of the primary endpoint showed a 19% reduction in risk of death in IL2 treated patients compared with placebo, which was not statistically significant. However, analysis adjusting for a pre-specified primary core biomarker, cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (CSF-pNFH), demonstrated a statistically significant decrease (73%) in the risk of death for the IL2 group over the 21-month trial period. Interaction by CSF-pNFH levels was found to be selective. The interaction on survival was not present in patients with high CSF-pNFH (21% of study participants), which corresponded with aggressive, fast progressing disease. However, patients with low to moderate CSF-pNFH levels (79% of study participants), correlating with less aggressive disease progression, demonstrated a significant decrease in the risk of death (43%) for the IL2 group. Similarly, a slowing of decline in ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised, a key metric in functional capability in patients with ALS) was found in the IL2 group of patients with low CSF-pNFH levels (c. 70% of study participants). The treatment was well tolerated, with adverse events recorded as mostly mild to moderate, occurring across both active treatment and placebo arms... https://www.clinigengroup.com/news/news-container/2022/clinigen-notes-results-from-the-mirocals-trial-investigating-low-dose-proleukin-aldesleukin-in-patients-with-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/; November 17, 2022 [Pooled Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No. C03 G. Bensimon, and P.N. Leigh ; on behalf of the MIROCALS Study Group Modifying immune response and outcomes in ALS (MIROCALS): design and results of a phase 2b, double-blind randomized placebocontrolled trial of low dose interleukin-2 (ld IL2) in ALS Results & conclusion: MIROCALS is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of low-dose IL2, delivered by sub-cutaneous injections (2MU) in 5-day cycles every 28 days, as in IMODALS. Volunteers with ALS (disease duration 24 months, VC 70%, not previously treated with riluzole, age 18–76, El Escorial Definite, Probable, Laboratory-Supported Probable, or Possible) were recruited to a 3-month ‘run-in’ while starting riluzole. Volunteers who tolerated riluzole were randomized to ld IL2 or a matching placebo. At selection and randomization, all volunteers were required to have blood and CSF sampling. A third CSF sample was collected at week 17 post-randomization. Blood sampling at other time points was taken for biomarker assays and for safety monitoring. 220 volunteers were randomized over 28 months in the UK (n¼ 83) and France (n¼ 137) in 17 ALS Centers. Treatment was continued for 18 months (548 days) but blinded follow-up and ascertainment of survival were maintained for all randomized volunteers until 21 months (640 days) after randomization. The Primary efficacy outcome was time to death (survival) at 21 months (640 days) post-randomization in the ITT population. Pre-specified survival analyses for treatment effect include stratified Log-rank and Cox proportional hazard models. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were: ALSFRS-R slope; SVC slope. Core biomarkers were CSF pNFH; CSF CCL2; and Tregs (number and percent of CD4 cells). EQol-5D was used to assess the quality of life.

Results: Compared to controls, patients with ALS were found to have reduced thickness of the right precentral gyrus cortex (p=0.022). Cortical thickness demonstrated a weak negative relationship with total blood CD4+ T cell count (p=0.04). Conclusion: This interim analysis has reproduced the finding of reduced primary motor cortex thickness in patients with ALS. Although further investigation is awaited on the full cohort, these findings provide evidence for immunological crosstalk between the blood and central nervous system relevant to mechanisms of disease in ALS.

GM604 slowed functional decline (ALSFRS-R) when compared to a historical control (P = 0.005). At one study site, a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups was found when comparing changes in respiratory function (FVC) between baseline and week 12 (P = 0.027). GM604 decreased plasma levels of key ALS biomarkers relative to the placebo group (TDP-43, P = 0.008; Tau, P = 0.037; SOD1, P = 0.009). The advanced ALS patient in compassionate treatment demonstrated improved speech, oral fluid consumption, mouth suction with GM604 treatment and biomarker improvements. Conclusions We observed favorable shifts in ALS biomarkers and improved functional measures during the Phase 2A study as well as in an advanced ALS patient. Although a larger trial is needed to confirm these findings, the present data are encouraging and support GM604 as an ALS drug candidate. https://f1000research.com/articles/6-230/v1 Full text: https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/11337/70ba5ba8-daad-45d9-845a-fa926c17a660_10519_-_mark_kindy.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.10519.1","Secondary Outcome Measures : ALSFRS-R (Amyotrophic Laeral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised) [ Time Frame: Symptom onset, screening, baseline, week 2, week 6, week 12 ] Progressive change in ALSFRS-R of each patient determined from the following data points:1) symptom onset, 2) baseline, 3) end of week 2 examination, 4) end of week 6 examination and 5) end of week 12 examination.

No serious adverse events (SAE) were observed during this study at the University Clinical Hospital and Instytut Terapii Komórkowych w Olsztynie (Cell Therapies Institute, FamiCord Group). Only one adverse event, i.e., headache (2.3% of the entire sample) was recorded during the first injection of WJ-MSC in a 62-year-old male who weighed 80 kg at the start of therapy. It was considered not serious by the physicians who conducted the study and resolved spontaneously after injection. The dose of WJ-MSC was 0.375 × 106 cells/kg – below the mean dose of the whole studied group. There was no any problem during the next two injections in this patient. No other adverse events were reported. Only adverse event occurring in one case was related to lumbar puncture. It manifested as a headache without any other signs and abnormalities at neurological examination. This can be explained in two ways: 1) neurosurgeons took a sample of 2 cm cerebrospinal fluid while puncturing the lumbar region and after that WJ-MSC mixture was injected into the spinal canal. There was no post-puncture lumbar syndrome observed because there was no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. After the procedure, the patient had to lie for 3 hours, received intravenous injection of 1 mL of isotonic fluid immediately after the puncture, another 1 L of isotonic fluid 12 hours later, and 2 L of oral liquid per day. 2) All procedures were performed by highly trained neurosurgeons, with the utmost precision that neurosurgeons put. Conclusion: This study confirms the safety of intrathecal injections of WJ-MSC in patients with ALS. No serious adverse events were observed. There was one adverse event that did not interfere with the whole therapy. Absence of other reported adverse events confirms that this therapy is well tolerated.

A phase I, pharmacokinetic, dosage escalation study of creatine monohydrate in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: Mean pre-dose steady-state creatine plasma concentrations were 20.3, 39.3, and 61.5 ug/ml at 5, 10, and 15 g b.i.d., respectively. Creatine spectra increased by 8% (p = 0.06) and glutamate + glutamine signals decreased by 17% (p = 0.039) at higher dosages. There were no safety concerns at any of the dosages. In conclusion, creatine plasma concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Creatine appears to cross the blood-brain barrier, and oral administration of 15 g b.i.d. is associated with increased in vivo brain creatine concentrations and decreased glutamate concentrations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20698808",,TrialTroveID-078979,,,,78979,Safety/Toxicity > Laboratory Measurements Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics,,,I,,0,2,0,2,0,3,7,PHARMACOKINETIC,0,0,0,0

Median survival duration was 10.39 months longer in PB&TURSO-randomized participants from CENTAUR (23.54 months) versus historical controls (13.15 months; HR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.31–0.72; P=.00048). Conclusions: The results of this analysis suggest a greater survival benefit with PB&TURSO than seen on ITT analysis in CENTAUR. The survival benefit attributed to PB&TURSO in this analysis aligns with prior analyses using statistical models controlling for placebo-to-active crossover in CENTAUR. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-001382.html; November 09, 2004 Neurology. 2004 Nov 9;63(9):1656-61.

CI analysis showed that the study, although powered to detect a 50% or greater change in rate of decline of muscle strength, actually made an effect size of greater than 23% unlikely. It was also demonstrated that motor unit number estimation was performed with acceptable reproducibility and tolerability, and may be a useful outcome measure in future clinical trials. Conclusion: Any beneficial effect of creatine at 5 g per day in ALS must be small. Other agents should be considered in future studies of therapeutic agents to address mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS. In addition, motor unit number estimation may be a useful outcome measure for future clinical trials in ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534251 http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/9/1656","The primary outcome measure was grip strength, ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised, and motor unit number estimates.",NEALS TrialTroveID-078978,The primary outcome measure was maximum voluntary isometric contraction of eight upper extremity muscles,,Grip Strength,78978,,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,,Iii,,2,0,1,0,0,0,3,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

Creatine monohydrate in ALS: effects on strength, fatigue, respiratory status and ALSFRS. Results: Patients were followed for nine months. The results showed that creatine monohydrate did not significantly improve motor, respiratory or functional capacity in this patient population. The drug was well tolerated and the study groups well balanced, especially considering the absence of forced vital capacity criteria for entrance into the study. There was a trend toward improved survival in patients taking daily creatine monohydrate and this was identical to the trend seen in another recently published report of creatine in ALS patients 1. Conclusions: In conclusion, creatine monohydrate (5 g/d) did not have an obvious benefit on the multiple markers of disease progression measured over nine months. We measured fatigue during isometric contraction and found no significant improvement despite anecdotal patient reports prior to and during the study. The trend toward improved survival was also found in another recently completed blinded trial using creatine monohydrate. Further investigation on the possible survival benefit of creatine in this patient population is ongoing. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18608103?dopt=Abstract http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/17482960802028890 Full Text Available: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631354/?tool=pubmed; 2005 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 2005 (Suppl 1); 6: 13–16 SESSION 2B CLINICAL TRIALS AND TRIAL DESIGN Abstarct: C11 Multi-Center clinical trial of Creatine Monohydrate in Patients with ALS. Results: Patient follow-up is expected to be completed in October 2005. Currently, creatine monohydrate has proven to be safe and well tolerated by evaluation of the data safety and monitoring committee. We anticipate positive effects on muscle fatigue which may account for the frequent reported subjective benefits. In addition, distinctions between this study and the prior controlled trials will be discussed. If the significant acute benefits of treatment (seen in the pilot study) are not sustained, implications of alternative dose cycling will be discussed. Conclusion: Based on preclinical and pilot data, creatine monohydrate appears to be an important therapy for consideration in the treatment of ALS patients. Complete data including the novel approach of measuring muscle fatigue in a clinical trial as well as the five years of experience with the study of creatine monohydrate will be presented. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=242","Secondary Outcome Measures Acute changes in muscle strength.

Results: After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. Conclusion The celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18608093 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/17482960802195632; December 03, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Abstract no.: C77 Gordon PH, Cheung Y-K, Levin B, Andrews H, Doorish C, Macarthur RB, Montes J, Bednarz K, Florence J, Rowin J, Boylan K, Mazaffar T, Kelkar P, Mitsumoto H, Chapin J, Bedlack R, Rivner M, Mccluskey Lf, Pestronk A, Graves M, Sorenson E, Barohn RI, Belsh JM, Lou J-S, Levine T, Saperstein D, Miller RG, Scelsa S, Tandan R Combination Drug Selection Trial In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: Of the 60 patients enrolled in pool I, 58 completed all 6 months and 2 died; there were no dropouts. The mean declines in ALSFRS-R were 6.47 (SD59.14) in the minocycline/creatine arm, 5.27 (5.54) in the celecoxib/creatine arm, and 5.82 (6.77) in the historical control group. The pooled sample standard deviation of the change in ALSFRS-R was 7.556; the numerical threshold for the selection criterion was 1.035 (0.7567.556/!30). The absolute difference between the two sample means was 1.20, exceeding the threshold in the selection stopping criterion. Next, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of superiority in the futility analysis. Conclusions: The selection criterion was met following pool I. We were able to close the trial early, selecting the celecoxib/creatine combination, which had a smaller mean decline than the minocycline/creatine arm, and was nonfutile in comparison to the historical controls. These data can now be used to design a phase III trial of combination therapy in ALS. This phase II construct was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and could be used in larger phase II selection trials assessing greater numbers of agents. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=916","Secondary Outcome Measures: Forced Vital Capacity, Quality of Life, Timed Get Up and Go performed monthly.

Results: Sialorrhoea assessed by gravimetry either after amitriptyline (1.43 + or - 0.39 and 0.91 + or - 0.61 ml\5 min; p < 0.05), or dysport (1.11 + or - 0.56 and 0.82 + or - 0.42 ml\5 min; p < 0.05) was significantly lower than before treatment. Three patients developed more then two amitriptyline side-effects. The dose was lowered (25 mg), then dysport was injected.

Notably, we observed lower levels of cytokines and the inflammatory marker fibrinogen during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Despite of this, we could not detect a significant reduction in disease progression during the same period in patients treated with ANA compared to controls as measured by the ALSFRSr. In the second part of the treatment period we observed an increase in serum inflammatory markers. Sixteen out of the 17 patients (94%) developed antibodies against ANA. Conclusion: This study showed that blocking IL–1 is safe in patients with ALS. Further trials should test whether targeting IL–1 more efficiently can help treating this devastating disease. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139684&type=printable; December 07, 2013 Presented at the 24th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-8, 2013, Milan, Italy Session Type: POSTER SESSION B Session Title: THEME 11 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES Abstract No.:P314 MAIER A , DEIGENDESCH N , EISSNER F , MOLAWI K , M Ü NCH C , HOLM T , MEYER R , MEYER T , ZYCHLINSKY A Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Treatment of als patients with Predominant lower motor neuron Involvement Results: As expected, there were very frequent skin reactions (58%) at the beginning of the therapy, which decreased in intensity and frequency during the treatment. Light to moderate headache was reported at least once by less than half of the patients (47%). We did not observe any serious side effects, but three patients dropped out during the trial (two due to ALS-related hypoventilation syndrome and one withdrew from the trial). Between 6 and 12 months of treatment, we found a statistically non-significant reduction of the intrain- dividual progression rate in patients with PMA compared to those with signs of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration.

RESULTS: In our prospective, open-label study, we enrolled a total of 276 patients (mean age 71 + or - 8 years, 95 males) with cognitive disorders. Our study population comprised four groups: no treatment group (n = 75), aniracetam monotherapy group (n = 58), ChEIs monotherapy group (n = 68), and group of combined treatment (n = 68). Patients were examined with validated neuropsychological tests at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. In patients treated with aniracetam, all studied parameters were adequately maintained at 6 and 12 months, while emotional state was significantly improved at 3 months. In patients treated with ChEIs, we observed a significant cognitive deterioration at 12 months. The comparison between aniracetam and ChEIs in patients with relatively mild dementia (15 < or = MMSE < or = 25) revealed a significantly better cognitive performance with aniracetam at 6 months and improved functionality at 3 months. Comparing aniracetam monotherapy with combined treatment in the same population, aniracetam performed better in the cognitive scale at 6 months, and displayed a notable tendency for enhanced mood at 12 months and improved functionality at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that aniracetam (a nootropic compound with glutamatergic activity and neuroprotective potential) is a promising option for patients with cognitive deficit of mild severity. It preserved all neuropsychological parameters for at least 12 months, and seemed to exert a favorable effect on emotional stability of demented patients. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22070796 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00244.x/abstract;jsessionid=FA80DCE2966197E63F88E6813ECA39C3.d01t03; March 10, 2010 Presented at the 25th International Conference of Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), March 10-13, 2010, Thessaloniki, Greece Abstract# OC055 M.

Koliaki The Effect of Aniracetam, Either as Monotherapy or Combined with Cholinesterase Inhibitors, on Neuropsychological Findings of Patients with dementia in Different Stages. (Data from the Greek Amnesia Study: Aniracetam Monotherapy Compared with Cholinesterase Results: Patients without treatment demonstrated a significant decline in cognitive performance at 12 months of follow-up (p=0.004). In patients treated with aniracetam, all studied parameters were adequately maintained at 6 and 12 months, while emotional state was significantly improved at 3 months (p=0.03). In patients treated with ChIs, we observed a statistically significant deterioration of cognitive status at 12 months (p=0.01). The combination treatment group exhibited a substantial amelioration of emotional profile at 3 months (p=0.04), but there was a significant worsening of mental and functional parameters at 12 months (p=0.04, p=0.05 respectively). The comparison between aniracetam and ChIs monotherapy in patients with moderate dementia (MMSE:15-25) revealed a significantly better cognitive performance in the aniracetam group at 6 months of treatment (MMSE= 23.4+or-3.1 vs. 18.7+or-4.2, p=0.005). When comparing aniracetam monotherapy with combination treatment in moderate dementia, aniracetam performed better in cognitive and functional scales at 6 months (p=0.002 and p=0.05), while the mood of patients treated with aniracetam was significantly enhanced at 12 months (p=0.03). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that aniracetam (an AMPA potentiator with glutamatergic activity and neuroprotective potential) is a promising option for patients with moderate cognitive deficit.

The median follow-up was 289 days (range 27-759) and there have been 12 deaths, none of which were attributed to MSC therapy (median death 334 days follow-ing injectio n (range 27-755)). The safety profile was positive, with the most common side-effects reported being temporary low back and leg pain at the highest dose level. Although the study was not designed for efficacy, ALSFRS-R was performed throughout the study and showed progression in all patients that did not appear, and was not reported by any patients, to be more rapid than prior to MSC therapy. Despite overall progression, 17 patients reported specific temporary clinical improvements following treatment. MSC therapy at the 50-100 million doses were associated with elevated CSF protein, nucleated cells and MRI imaging of thickened lumbosacral nerve roots. Preliminary autopsy data did not reveal any tumor formation, andmay suggest implantation of MSCs in the lumbosacral nerve roots. Biomarker studies of peripheral blood immune status and CSF miRNA are ongoing. Conclusions: In conclusion, intrathecal treatment of autologous adipose-derived MSCs appears safeat the tested doses in ALS. These results warrant further exploration in a multi-treatment Phase II trial, and our design for this will be presented.

No important safety signals were reported in the trial. Topline data will be presented at the upcoming virtual European Network to Cure ALS (ENCALS) meeting, May 12-14, and complete data from the study will be published later this year. “We are disheartened by these results, as we had hoped arimoclomol might represent a viable new approach against the formidable challenge of this devastating disease. We express our sincere thanks to the investigators, patients and families for their participation and collaboration in our program,” said Thomas Blaettler, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Orphazyme. “With over 18 months of evaluation, this trial represents one of the longest running clinical studies in this category. While unsuccessful, the data generated will contribute meaningfully to the scientific dialogue on this challenging disease. We will apply the invaluable insights from this and other studies to further our pipeline as we continue to pursue the full potential of the heat shock protein response.” The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial was conducted among 245 patients at 29 sites in 12 countries in North America and Europe. Participants were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either arimoclomol (248 mg three times daily)i or placebo for up to 76 weeks. The primary endpoint was to determine the efficacy of chronic treatment with arimoclomol compared to placebo in participants with ALS as assessed by the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS). This endpoint was selected to illustrate the overall treatment effect based on survival and the change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Secondary endpoints included survival, change in ALSFRS-R, and slow vital capacity (SVC). https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225216/0/en/Orphazyme-announces-topline-data-from-pivotal-trial-of-arimoclomol-in-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS.html",Time to Permanent Assisted Ventilation (PAV) / Tracheostomy / Death [ Time Frame: Over 76 weeks ] Time from baseline to one of the events (PAV / tracheostomy / death).

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of arimoclomol in rapidly progressive SOD1 ALS. Results: Thirty-eight participants were randomized. Thirty-six (19 placebo, 17 arimoclomol) were included in the prespecified intent-to-treat analysis. Apart from respiratory function, groups were generally well-balanced at baseline. Adverse events occurred infrequently, and were usually mild and deemed unlikely or not related to study drug. Adjusting for riluzole and baseline ALSFRS-R, survival favored arimoclomol with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.80). ALSFRS-R and FEV6 declined more slowly in the arimoclomol group, with treatment differences of 0.5 point/month (95% CI -0.63 to 1.63) and 1.24 percent predicted/month (95% CI -2.77 to 5.25), respectively, and the CAFS similarly favored arimoclomol. Conclusion: This study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months. Although not powered for therapeutic effect, the consistency of results across the range of prespecified efficacy outcome measures suggests a possible therapeutic benefit of arimoclomol. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367439 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818014/pdf/NEUROLOGY2017818120.pdf","Secondary Outcome Measures : Rate of decline of ALSFRS-R (ALS functional rating scale-revised) over a period of up to 12 months.

No adverse events (AEs) related to AstroRx itself were reported. Transient AEs related to the Intrathecal (IT) procedure were all mild to moderate. The study demonstrated a clinically meaningful effect that was maintained over the first 3 months after treatment, as measured by the pre-post slope change in ALSFRS-R. In the 100 × 106 AstroRx arm, the ALSFRS-R rate of deterioration was attenuated from - 0.88/month pre-treatment to - 0.30/month in the first 3 months post-treatment (p = 0.039). In the 250 × 106 AstroRx arm, the ALSFRS-R slope decreased from - 1.43/month to - 0.78/month (p = 0.0023). The effect was even more profound in a rapid progressor subgroup of 5 patients. No statistically significant change was measured in muscle strength using hand-held dynamometry and slow vital capacity continued to deteriorate during the study. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that a single IT administration of AstroRx to ALS patients at a dose of 100 × 106 or 250 × 106 cells is safe. A signal of beneficial clinical effect was observed for the first 3 months following cell injection. These results support further investigation of repeated intrathecal administrations of AstroRx, e.g., every 3 months. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36788520/ [Full text available at below source URL] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9927047/; October 3, 2021 Presented at the 25th World Congress of Neurology (WCN), October 3-7, 2021, Virtual meeting Abstract No. EP0625 / #2649 Michal Izrael, Marc Gotkine, Guy Slutsky, Yossef Lerner, Judith Chebath, Graciela Kuperstein, Elena Estrin, Yoseph Caraco, Tamir Ben-Hur, Arik Hasson, Tehila Sonnefeld, Yafit Stark, Ariel Revel, Michel Revel SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF FIRST-IN-HUMAN INTRATHECAL TRANSPLANTATION OF HUMAN ASTROCYTES (ASTRORX®) IN ALS PATIENTS: PHASE I/IIA CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS Results: AstroRx treatment was well tolerated in both doses and no treatment-related serious-adverseevents nor dose-limiting toxicities related to AstroRx were reported. A potentially clinically meaningful decline in disease-progression, assessed by the ALS Functional-Rating-Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), was observed during the first 3-months of the 6-month follow-up period in both cohorts. Conclusions: Single-dose transplantation of AstroRx is safe and demonstrated a promising efficacy during the first 3-months. These results support a further, randomized-controlled, clinical trial with repeated doses of AstroRx in ALS patients, in order to prolong the time-span of the clinical effect observed by single-dose.

(TASE: KDST) ...announced today encouraging results of Cohort B of its Phase 1/2a clinical trial of AstroRx® for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety of AstroRx, an ""off-the-shelf"", clinical-grade, astrocyte cell product, developed and manufactured by the Company. A secondary objective of the trial included preliminary efficacy assessments. All 5 patients included in cohort B were treated with a dose of 250x106 AstroRx cells and completed the 6-month post-treatment follow up period. No treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) nor dose-limiting toxicities were reported during the 6- month post-treatment follow up period of Cohort B, indicating a positive safety profile of the AstroRx® dose provided. An efficacy analysis of the 6-month follow up period was performed to assess the duration of which the treatment maintains its therapeutic effect after a single AstroRx administration. The efficacy assessment was based on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the gold standard outcome for assessment of ALS progression. The rate of ALS disease progression in Cohort B patients, as assessed by the ALSFRS-R slope difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment periods, was significantly reduced from -1.43/month during the 3-4 month run-in period before treatment to -0.78/month during the 3-month follow-up after treatment, reflecting a clinically meaningful signal and statistically significant (p=0.0023) decline of 45% in the disease progression rate. At the end of the 6-month post-treatment period, the rate of ALSFRS-R progression was similar to the rate that was measured before treatment... https://www.kadimastem.com/post/encouraging-results-of-cohort-b-of-its-phase-1-2a-clinical-trial-of-astrorx-for-als; August 03, 2020 [Interim Results, Press release] Kadimastem Reports Positive Interim Results of Cohort B of its AstroRx® Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial in - AstroRx® demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in the higher treatment dose - Clinically meaningful decline in disease progression following AstroRx® treatment consistent in Cohorts A and B - Company notifies of strategic development update NESS ZIONA, Israel, August 03, 2020 --- Kadimastem Ltd. (TASE: KDST), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cell therapies for the treatment of severe debilitating diseases, announced today that its lead product, AstroRx®, showed a positive efficacy signal and a good safety profile in Cohort B of the Company’s Phase 1/2a clinical trial in ALS. ""The current study results are encouraging, as they suggest a clinically meaningful signal of effect. A further randomized, parallel-controlled, clinical trial is needed to confirm these positive effects of AstroRx® in the treatment of ALS,"" said Dr. Marc Gotkine, Department of Neurology at Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem and the Principal Investigator of the Phase 1/2a clinical trial of AstroRx®... Earlier this year, due to COVID-19, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the Phase 1/2a clinical trial recommended to put additional cohorts on hold to ensure the safety and well-being of the patients. Considering the ongoing situation presented by COVID-19 in Israel, the uncertainty and setbacks imposed, the Company decided to not pursue the additional cohorts of the current Phase 1/2a clinical trial... Study Design The Phase 1/2a trial is an open label, dose-escalating, clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of AstroRx® cells in patients with ALS. The primary objectives of the trial were safety evaluation and tolerability of a single administration of allogeneic astrocytes derived from human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC), administered in escalating doses. The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy, including ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the gold standard scale to assess ALS progression by monitoring patient muscle functions over time. In the previously reported Cohort A, 5 patients were administered with a dose of 100X106 AstroRx® cells. In Cohort B, 5 additional patients were treated with a single, higher dose of 250x106 AstroRx® cells. Treatment was provided concomitantly with standard-of-care. Primary Objective: Safety Similarly to Cohort A, no treatment-related serious adverse events nor dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the treatment was well tolerated in the higher cell dose. Secondary Objective: Efficacy To identify decline in disease progression following treatment, ALSFRS-R slope analysis was performed and compared between the pre- and post-treatment periods. The starting point for the slope of the post-treatment period was referred to in the slope analysis in two ways: at first visit after treatment (Day 30, as previously published for Cohort A) and before treatment administration (Day -1). Both analyses were conducted. - The rate of ALS disease progression in Cohort B patients, as assessed by the ALSFRS-R slope difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment (from Day -1) periods, was significantly reduced from -1.43/month during the 3-4 month run-in period before treatment to -0.78/month during 3-month follow-up after treatment, reflecting a clinically meaningful signal and statistically significant (p=0.0023) decline of 45% in disease progression rate. - The rate of ALS disease progression in Cohort B patients, as assessed by the ALSFRS-R slope difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment (from Day 30) periods, was significantly reduced from -1.42/month in the pre-treatment period to -0.41/month in the post-treatment period (p=0.0006), reflecting a decline of 71% in disease progression rate. - Pooling the data of the two Cohorts treated with AstroRx® (n=10, from Day -1) exhibited an even more robust and clinically meaningful effect: - The ALSFRS-R slope was significantly reduced from -1.15/month in the pre-treatment period to a rate of -0.54/month post-treatment (p=0.0004). These results reflect a decline of 53% in disease progression rate. - Responder analysis, as assessed by the improvement of at least 25% in the ALSFRS-R rate of decline between pre-treatment and post-treatment periods, demonstrated that 70% of Cohort A & B patients treated with AstroRx® were identified as responders. - Post-hoc efficacy (by ALSFRS-R) analysis of rapid progressors: Rapid progressors are defined as patients who deteriorate at least 1.1 points of ALSFRS-R per month in the run-in period. The treatment effect was even higher when assessing the rapid progressor subpopulation of patients from both cohorts (n=5/10, from Day -1): - Slope analysis of ALSFRS-R demonstrated a reduction from -1.58/month in the run-in to -0.65/month during the post treatment, which reflects a decline of 59% in disease progression (p = 0.0003) - Change from baseline in the mean decline of ALSFRS-R during the pre-treatment period in rapid progressors was -4.74 points over 90 days. In contrast, the mean decline in the post-treatment period was reduced to -2.77 over 90 days, a decline of 1.97 ALSFRS-R points per 3 months. - In Responder analysis, 80% of rapid progressor patients treated with AstroRx® were identified as responders. The final results of the 6-month follow-up post-treatment for Cohort B are expected in Q4 2020. https://www.kadimastem.com/post/kadimastem-reports-positive-interim-results-of-cohort-b-of-its-astrorx-phase-1-2a-clinical-trial-in; January 6, 2020 [Press release] Kadimastem Announces Promising Results of Cohort A of its Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial in ALS - No treatment-related serious adverse events nor dose-limiting toxicities were reported - A statistically significant decline in disease progression was observed during the first 3 - 4 months post-treatment period, indicating a clinical benefit of the AstroRx® cell product, suggesting a higher dose and/or repeated treatments may achieve prolonged efficacy - First patient has been enrolled to cohort C which is designed to further assess safety and prolonged efficacy of repeated administrations NESS ZIONA, Israel, Jan. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Kadimastem Ltd..., today announced promising results of cohort A of its Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of AstroRx®, an ""off-the-shelf"" clinical-grade astrocyte cell product, developed and manufactured by the Company. A secondary objective of the trial includes preliminary efficacy assessments. All 5 patients included in cohort A were treated with a dose of 100x10^6 AstroRx® cells and completed the 6 months post-treatment follow up period. No treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs) nor dose-limiting toxicities were reported during the 6 months post-treatment follow up period of cohort A, suggesting a positive safety profile of the AstroRx® dose provided. Efficacy analysis of the 6 months follow up period was performed to assess the time frame during which the treatment maintains its therapeutic effect. The efficacy assessment was based on ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the gold standard criteria to assess ALS progression by monitoring patient muscle functions over time. During the 3 months pre-treatment period, the ALSFRS-R decreased at an average rate of (-0.87) per month. This rate of decrease is similar to that reported in the scientific literature. The analysis examined the average rate of disease progression at 3, 4, 5 and 6-months post-treatment periods compared to the average rate during the 3-months pre-treatment period. The average ALSFRS-R change in the 3 months post-treatment was (+0.26) per month. These results demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the slope in the pre-treatment period and the slope in the 3 months post-treatment period (p = 0.0023). The average ALSFRS-R change in the 4 months post-treatment period was (-0.32) per month. These results also indicate a statistically significant difference between the slope in the pre-treatment period and the slope in the 4 months post-treatment period (p = 0.0447). These findings indicate that for a period of 3-4 months following treatment the progression of the disease was reduced, providing a potentially meaningful clinical benefit to the patients. In the 5- and 6-months post-treatment periods, a statistically significant difference was not observed between the rate of disease deterioration during these periods and the rate during the pre-treatment period. These findings indicate a clinical benefit is achieved and sustained for a period of 3-4 months following treatment and further suggest a higher dose and/or repeated administrations may achieve prolonged efficacy. Furthermore, these findings align with the design of the clinical trial as planned for cohort B and C, respectively, as in cohort B the effect of a higher dose is assessed, and cohort C will examine the therapeutic effect of repeated treatments. In cohort B, treatment has been completed with a higher dose of 250x10^6 AstroRx® cells. First patient has already been enrolled to cohort C, which is intended to further assess safety and prolonged efficacy, with 2 consecutive injections of AstroRx® cells separated by an interval of 2-3 months. ""ALS is a devastating disease and there is a critical need for new treatments to more effectively slow down or halt its rapid progression"", stated Dr. Marc Gotkine, Department of Neurology at Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, and the Principal Investigator of the trial. ""These results on a small subset of patients of the first experimental group treated with 100 million AstroRx® cells are encouraging, as the treatment seems to be safe. After completion of 6 months follow up period, initial data analysis presented to us appears to demonstrate a transient efficacy benefit that lasted for 3-4 months post treatment as measured by ALSFRS-R deterioration rate. The trial is now continuing with higher doses and repeated injections"". Rami Epstein, CEO of Kadimastem, stated: ""We are very encouraged by the final cohort A results, demonstrating AstroRx® provides a meaningful clinical benefit in terms of the ALSFRS-R rating scale. We look forward to continue our study, assessing the potential long-term benefits of a higher dose regimen as well as repeated administrations of our breakthrough Cell Therapy."" Prof. Michel Revel, Founder and CSO of the Company, added, ""These results clearly support a desirable safety profile of our AstroRx® astrocyte cell-based product. This provides the confidence needed to move forward to the repeated injections in the forthcoming cohort C. Since in cohort A the clinical response was clearly demonstrated to last for at least 3-4 months following cell injection, cohort B will include a higher dose of cells, and cohort C will include repeated injections with approximately 3-month intervals. Both cohort B and C hold a potential promise for a prolonged response. The positive safety profile also allows us to test AstroRx® in other neurodegenerative diseases."" About the Phase 1/2a ALS Clinical Trial The Phase 1/2a trial is an open label, dose escalating clinical trial intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AstroRx® cells in patients with ALS. The trial is expected to include 21 patients and is being conducted at the Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. The primary endpoints of the trial are safety evaluation and tolerability of a single and repeated administrations of allogeneic astrocytes derived from human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC), produced in accordance with a process developed by the Company and administered in escalating doses. Secondary endpoints include efficacy evaluation and measurements. Treatment is administered in addition to the appropriate standard-of-care. An amendment to the protocol is in process. The purpose of the amendment is to assess the safety and efficacy of a repeated dose administration of 100x10^6 of AstroRx® in cohort C, in 2 consecutive injections, separated by an interval of 2-3 months, rather than the repeated administrations of the 250x10^6 dose, as originally planned. As part of the proposed protocol amendment, cohort D will include a repeated dose of (250x10^6) AstroRx® cells (as originally planned in cohort C). Performance of cohort D will be discretionary, based on the results of previous cohorts. Results of cohort B are expected to be reported during August 2020. Results of cohort C are expected in the first half of 2021. ...About Kadimastem ...AstroRx®, the Company's lead program, is a clinical-grade astrocyte cell therapy for the treatment of ALS, currently undergoing a Phase 1/2a clinical trial...

Treatment emergent adverse events were uncommon, mild, and self-limited. There were 18 serious adverse events (SAEs) which were related to disease progression and unrelated (17) or likely unrelated (1) to IC14. Three participants died due to disease progression. Most participants achieved >80% monocyte mCD14 RO on a 14-day dosing schedule, although one individual required more frequent dosing (every 10 days) to achieve >80% RO. ADA were detected in only one participant and were transient, low titer, and non-neutralizing. Tregs were isolated from the available longitudinal samples and assayed for suppression of CD4 T cell proliferation and cytokine production versus baseline T-reg activity. Conclusion: IC14 administration to ALS patients was safe and well tolerated in this EAP, with no significant changes in laboratory tests and no drug-related SAEs. Measuring RO guided dosing frequency. Preliminary data suggest IC14 enhanced T-reg activity. Additional placebo-controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of IC14 in ALS. https://2022.myana.org/sites/default/files/images/2022/ana_v92_is29_rev2.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36533976/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27775; November 5, 2020 [Interim results] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 21, Issue supplement 2, November 2020 Presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2020, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 5, 2020 Abstract No.: CLT-28 Mr Dario Gelevski, Ms Margot Rohrer, Ms Taylor Stirrat, Ms Margaret Bruno, Ms Judith Carey, Ms Jennifer Scalia, Ms Cassandra Lieberman, Ms Megan Yerton, Mr Michael Doyle, Ms Grace Addy, Mr Neil Parikh, Ms Amy Swartz, Ms Katherine Burke, Mr Alexander Sherman, Ms Hong Yu, Dr Jan Agosti, Dr David Crowe, Mr Garry Redlich, Dr. Mark Appleby, Dr Brian Ziegelaar, Dr Katharine Nicholson, Dr Sabrina Paganoni, Dr James Berry, Ms Sarah Luppino, Dr Merit Cudkowicz IC14 in ALS: Expanded Access Program (EAP) Results: Participants received IC14 up to 31 weeks (average exposure: 24.9 weeks, range: 11-31 weeks). IC14 was well tolerated. One participant terminated after 28 weeks due to ALS progression. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were falls (n=11) and headaches (n=8); all deemed unrelated to IC14. Treatment-emergent AES (TEASs) deemed probably related to study drug were tongue paresthesias (n=1) and systemic exhaustion (n=1). There were six unrelated serious adverse events (SAEs): bilateral pulmonary emboli (n=1), deep vein thrombosis, fever of unknown etiology (n=1), pneumonia (n=1), and worsening dysphagia (n=2). There were no significant changes in vital signs, exams, or safety labs. CD14 RO increased for all participants after infusion with IC14, with sustained RO of > or = 80% noted typically after the second infusion, when infusions were administered 14 days apart. In four participants, serum pNfH levels decreased after baseline, two had an increase in pNfH levels, and data for one participant is pending. We observed a significant increase in T-Reg suppressive activity from 31.91% to 63.43% over six doses in one participants and 22.16% to 36% in three doses in another. ADA was undetected in five participants that received up to nine IC14 infusions over 17 weeks. Conclusion: IC14 infusions were safe with no significant changes in laboratory tests, vital signs or ophthalmologic examinations when administered for up to 31 weeks. IC14 was successfully administered at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. TEAEs were uncommon, mild, and self-limited. RO data suggest that ideal dosing frequency is likely every 14 days, although personalized titration based on RO might be needed. Preliminary but encouraging data suggest that CD14 neutralization improves T-Reg suppressive function. Data collected in this EAP helped inform the design of a planned randomized clinical trial of IC14 in a larger cohort of people with ALS.

Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Results of Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial. Results: In total, 26 patients were enrolled in the study and were assessed for safety; 23 patients were suitable for efficacy evaluation. After intrathecal BM-MSC application, about 30% of the patients experienced a mild to moderate headache, resembling the headaches after a standard lumbar puncture. No suspected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) were observed. We found a reduction in ALSFRS decline at 3 months after application (p?<?0.02) that, in some cases, persisted for 6 months ( p?<?0.05). In about 80% of the patients, FVC values remained stable or above 70% for a time period of 9 months. Values of WS were stable in 75% of patients at 3 months after application. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the intrathecal application of BM-MSCs in ALS patients is a safe procedure and that it can slow down progression of the disease. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938483 Full text available at http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/cog/ct/2017/00000026/00000004/art00010?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf","Secondary objectives: Efficacy: To assess progress of the disease measured according to ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS) and Norris scale and spirometry (FVC) after the AMSC treatment Secondary end point: ALS disease progression (assessment of functional deterioration milestones) Timepoint(s) of evaluation: At 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months following treatment administration.

Significant changes in multiple ALS disease pathways support NurOwn's mechanism of action and complement clinical effects observed in ALS... ...This study suggests that debamestrocel or NurOwn®, an investigational cell therapy, may impact key biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that are predictive of disease progression... ...The study analyzed forty-five biomarkers and identified three that are predictive of clinical outcomes in debamestrocel-treated participants, including neurofilaments light (NfL), LAP/TGFb1 and Galcetin-1. Treatment with debamestrocel led to significant changes in 64% of the forty-five analyzed biomarkers, spanning various pathways involved in ALS pathology. These changes included increases in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective markers suggesting a potential ability to reduce inflammation and protect neurons, and decreases in inflammatory and neurodegenerative markers indicating a possible reduction in disease activity and nerve cell damage. ""The publication of these findings is important, because it demonstrates a potential biologic mechanism by which modified mesenchymal stem cells (debamestrocel) may benefit patients with ALS,"" said Dr. Anthony J. Windebank, MD, Professor of Neurology and Judith and Jean Pape Adams Professor of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science. ""There was a strong signal in the phase III trial suggesting a benefit of these cells in a sub-group of patients with less advanced disease... ...""These findings are encouraging and provide preliminary evidence that debamestrocel may be effective in treating ALS.

The study was conducted at 6 clinical sites in the USA. A total of 263 participants were screened for the study, and 196 participants (74.5% of participants screened) were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either NurOwn or placebo. Pre-assignment Details: The most common reasons that participants did not meet inclusion criteria were failure to meet the SVC inclusion criterion at the Screening Visit or the required pre-treatment decline in ALSFRSR total score at the randomization visit. From the ITT population, 3 participants in the NurOwn group and 4 participants in the placebo group discontinued prior to treatment. Limitations and Caveats: This trial had a unique and atypical trial population that included more participants than anticipated with advanced ALS, who had a low ALSFRS-R score. As compared with recent large ALS clinical trials, this study population is an outlier, with a mean overall ALSFRS-R score at baseline lower than other studies, and this impacted the power of this study.

Cudkowicz1, K. Taylor2and S. Lindborg NurOwn autologous stem cell transplant- a precision medicine approach using mesenchymal stem cell neurotrophic factors for ALS Results: MSC-NTF treatment was well tolerated; there were no safety concerns. 33% of MSC-NTF and 28% of placebo participants met clinical response criteria at 28 wks (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.33, p ¼ 0.45); thus, the primary endpoint was not met. A pre-specified analysis of participants with baseline ALSFRS-R 35 (n ¼ 58) showed a clinical response rate at 28 wk of 35% MSC-NTF and 16% placebo (OR ¼ 2.6, p ¼ 0.29). We observed statistically significant changes in 29 of the 45 (64%) CSF biomarkers studied following treatment with NurOwn across key pathways implicated in ALS path- ology. The placebo group remained unchanged. NurOwn showed biological activity in the overall population, including participants with advanced ALS at baseline where a floor effect of the ALSFRS-R impacted the ability to measure clin- ical decline. Conclusions: Personalized treatment approaches for people living with ALS can be incorporated into ALS trials. This study did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. However, the pre-specified subgroup results suggest that MSC-NTF participants with less severe disease, which mini- mizes the impact of the floor effect of the scale, may have retained more function compared to placebo. These data compel us to further study autologous MSC-NTFs in ALS. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; September 27, 2023 [Press release] BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Provides Update on FDA Advisory Committee Meeting to Review NurOwn for the Treatment of ALS ...Today the Committee voted that NurOwn did not demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness for treatment of mild to moderate ALS... ...The Phase 3 pivotal trial of NurOwn did not reach statistical significance on the primary or secondary endpoints, likely due to a ""floor effect,"" which confounds measurement of disease progression in patients with more advanced disease.

(NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, this week presented new biomarker data from the Phase 3 trial of its late-stage investigational ALS treatment, NurOwn at the 2023 ALS and Related Motor Neuron Diseases Gordon Research Conference. These data show that treatment with NurOwn significantly elevated markers of neuroprotection and lowered markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including neurofilament light (NfL) over time compared to placebo in all trial participants. New data analysis presented this week was motivated by the regulatory precedent set by a recent FDA drug approval in ALS, and the knowledge gained through the regulatory process, suggesting that the blood-based biomarker neurofilament light (NfL) is associated with disease prognosis and progression in patients with ALS and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. It is believed that reductions in plasma NfL are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in ALS... ...About the data analysis The presentation, titled ""CSF biomarkers identified as predictive of clinical outcomes in ALS participants following NurOwn treatment in a phase 3 clinical trial: Reductions in NfL associated with less ALSFRS-R decline"", examined biomarkers that were pre-specified in the NurOwn study: 16 pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory, eight neurodegeneration, and nine neuroprotection biomarkers. This analysis is the largest biomarker study conducted in people living with ALS. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for all participants in the trial seven times, per the protocol. The data provide further evidence of the importance of NfL as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. The addition of baseline disease covariates and additional biomarkers to NfL encompassing inflammation and neuroprotection more fully explains the clinical response to NurOwn observed in the trial... ...Highlights of the biomarker analysis: - Statistical modeling identifies three biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes observed with NurOwn-treatment in the Phase 3 trial (BCT-002), including change in Galectin-1 and baseline biomarkers NfL and LAP/TGFβ1, highlighting the importance of three pathways important to ALS in the observed clinical outcomes. - Baseline disease characteristics pre-specified in the primary efficacy model were included as covariates in the statistical analysis of biomarker data, following 2023 FDA guidance and ALS industry standard. These covariates were all found to be important in the analysis of clinical outcomes (p<.001, each covariate), in addition to biomarker data. - Accounting for baseline disease covariates, NurOwn treated participants had reduced NfL values from baseline to week 20 compared to placebo (p<0.05). - NfL baseline levels were prognostic of ALS disease progression, confirming results from other ALS trials. Participants with greater decline from baseline at week 28 as measured by ALSFRS-R total score, had higher baseline NfL values, r=-0.33, p=0.0064. - Causal Inference using a natural disease progression model showed a relationship between reductions due to NurOwn in NfL changes from baseline and ALSFRS-R changes from baseline. The correlation between NurOwn-driven changes at the final measure in NfL (week 20) and ALSFRS-R (week 28), after adjusting for the predicted changes due to natural disease progression, was r=-0.365, p=0.087. This analysis was conducted in participants who had all ALSFRS-R items >1 at baseline... ...About NurOwn ...The Phase 3 pivotal trial NurOwn did not reach statistical significance on the primary or secondary endpoints, likely due to a ""floor effect,"" which confounds measurement of disease progression in patients with more advanced disease. A thorough analysis of NurOwn Phase 3 data shows evidence of clinically meaningful effectiveness in ALS participants who have not progressed to advanced levels of disease progression. In a pre-specified group of participants with an ALSFRS-R score ³35, there was a larger treatment effect across all endpoints with NurOwn compared to placebo, which aligned with historical trials and the study power assumptions. With a statistically significant difference on a key endpoint (change from baseline in ALSFRS-R). Additionally, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis of patients across threshold of >26 through ≥35 on the ALSFRS-R highlighted that NurOwn-treated patients retain, on average, two points of function more compared to placebo -- clinically meaningful preservation and important for quality of life for a person living with ALS and their loved ones. NurOwn's clinical program also included the largest cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker study ever done in ALS, strong and consistent biomarker data, which are predictive of clinical response in the trial, span pathways that are important to ALS (neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, neuroprotection), and align with NurOwn's mechanism of action. Biomarker data in all trial participants showed consistent biological patterns of NurOwn reducing markers of inflammation and neurodegeneration and increasing neuroprotective markers relative to placebo. Biomarker patterns were consistent across all NurOwn-participants, including in those with Advanced ALS disease where clinical scales, such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale, have demonstrated measurement challenges. Three CSF biomarkers were predictive of clinical outcomes in NurOwn-treated participants– neurofilament light (NfL), galectin-1, latency associated peptide of TGF-beta1 (LAP or TGF-b). The NurOwn clinical program has generated valuable insights into the pathology of ALS, as well as disease progression and treatment. Since the initial Phase 3 readout, BrainStorm has shared the full dataset through rigorous peer-reviewed analysis, including: quantification of Floor Effect, which had been noted but never before explored in depth; evaluation of multiple pre-specified biomarkers, collected at seven different points across 20 weeks during the trial, allowing a longitudinal view; and analysis of genetic data, which represents one of the first ALS trials to prospectively invoke pharmacogenomic analysis of clinical outcome, offering great promise for the development of future treatments for ALS... https://ir.brainstorm-cell.com/2023-07-07-BrainStorm-Cell-Therapeutics-Data-Show-Treatment-with-NurOwn-Significantly-Reduces-NfL,-a-Key-Biomarker-of-Neurodegeneration; November 7, 2022 [Press release] [Post-hoc analysis] BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Presents New Analyses from NurOwn's Phase 3 ALS Trial at the 21st Annual NEALS Meeting New post-hoc analyses that account for ALSFRS-R floor effects add to the robust body of evidence supporting a clinically meaningful treatment effect with NurOwn in ALS NEW YORK, Nov. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of cellular therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the presentation of a poster with new analyses from NurOwn's placebo-controlled Phase 3 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) trial that account for limitations in the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and provide evidence of a clinically meaningful treatment effect. The poster, titled, 'Further Analysis of NurOwn Phase 3 Data Based on Baseline ALSFRS-R Status Clarifies Treatment Outcomes' was presented at the 21st Annual NEALS Meeting, taking place in Clearwater Beach, FL and virtually. The presenting authors of the poster are Stacy Lindborg PhD, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer at BrainStorm and Merit Cudkowicz, MD, MSC, Chief of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital. A copy of the poster is available on the Events & Presentation page of Brainstorm's corporate website... ...Two orthogonal approaches designed to account for ALSFRS-R's inability to accurately assess disease progression in patients with advanced ALS demonstrate a statistical trend towards a clinically meaningful treatment effect with NurOwn, and one that is consistent with the pre-specified subgroup of participants with less advanced ALS at baseline (ALSFRS-R ≥ 35). We believe this consistency, together with the biomarker data we reported last month at the ALS ONE Symposium, adds weight to the important conclusions we can draw from our new analyses.""... ...This presentation provides new insights into the NurOwn phase 3 trial demonstrating the consistency of treatment effect with NurOwn... ...Poster Highlights NurOwn Phase 3 Trial Patient Population and ALSFRS-R Floor Effect As previously described, the mean ALSFRS-R score of participants in NurOwn's Phase 3 trial was 30.9 (± 6.3), which is substantially lower than the mean ALSFRS-R score of participants in other late-stage ALS trials. In addition, NurOwn's Phase 3 trial included participants with individual ALSFRS-R item scores of zero at baseline, meaning further deterioration could not be measured on these items and resulting in a slowing of ALS decline due to a floor effect of the ALSFRS-R that could result in a misclassification of the primary endpoint. This floor effect impacted all analyses based on ALSFRS-R, including those related to the trial's pre-specified primary endpoint (a responder analysis based on the percentage of participants with ≥1.25 points/month ALSFRS-R improvement in slope post-treatment vs. pre-treatment), which was not met. Pre-specified Subgroup Analyses As previously announced, a treatment difference favoring NurOwn over placebo was observed in a pre-specified subgroup of participants with less advanced disease (ALSFRS-R baseline score of ≥35) across both the primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint (average ALSFRS-R change from baseline to week 28). The difference between NurOwn and placebo for this key secondary endpoint was nominally statistically significant (p=0.050). Moreover, the clinical response observed with NurOwn and placebo in this pre-specified subgroup was consistent with historical data utilized in the NurOwn trial's power calculations. Post-hoc Analyses to Account for ALSFRS-R Floor Effects -To better understand the true effect of treatment with NurOwn compared to placebo, two post-hoc sensitivity analysis methods were used to identify and remove participants from analyses that were most likely to be impacted by the floor effect. These methods were: (1) Total Score Threshold (TST), which removed participants with ALSFRS-R scores ≤ 25; and (2) Item Level Threshold (ITL), which removed participants with a baseline score of 0 or 1 in at least 5 of 6 of the ALSFRS-R's Fine and Gross Motor scale items. Applying the TST and ITL sensitivity analysis methods resulted in the exclusion of 23% (n=44) and 16% (n=30) of trial participants from analyses, respectively. -Both the TST and ILT sensitivity analysis methods show that, after controlling for the impact of the ALSFRS-R floor effect, participants treated with NurOwn had a higher rate of clinical response (primary endpoint) and less function lost across 28 weeks (secondary endpoint), compared to placebo. Additional post-hoc analyses published for the secondary endpoint (average change from baseline in ALSFRS-R), showed a statistically significant benefit following treatment with NurOwn in all subgroups with ALSFRS-R baseline total score of at least 26 to 35 (p≤0.050). These analyses were included in a correction made to the Muscle and Nerve publication (December 2021) and were broadly discussed with the ALS community for the first time at the NEALS meeting. Biomarker Data Biomarker data from participants in the Phase 3 trial recently presented at the ALS ONE Research Symposium showed consistent patterns across biomarkers in both participants with more advanced ALS at baseline and those with less advanced disease. This suggests that NurOwn had similar biological activity on all participants in the trial, and that participants may also be benefiting from treatment clinically despite the inability of ALSFRS-R to accurately assess these benefits in certain participants due to a floor effect... https://ir.brainstorm-cell.com/2022-11-07-BrainStorm-Cell-Therapeutics-Presents-New-Analyses-from-NurOwns-Phase-3-ALS-Trial-at-the-21st-Annual-NEALS-Meeting; October 7, 2022 [Press release] BrainStorm Presents New Biomarker Analyses from NurOwn's Phase 3 ALS Trial at the ALS ONE Research Symposium ...NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the presentation of new biomarker analyses supporting the therapeutic benefit of NurOwn® in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the ongoing 5th Annual ALS ONE Research Symposium. The presentation was delivered by Dr. Stacy Lindborg, Chief Development Officer at Brainstorm, and entitled, ""The Relationship between CSF Biomarkers and Efficacy of Treatment with NurOwn (MSC-NTF cells)."" ""The new biomarker analyses presented today provide further evidence of NurOwn's multifaceted mechanism of action and show consistent patterns in study participants regardless of the level of disease progression at baseline,"" said Dr. Stacy Lindborg, Chief Development Officer at Brainstorm. ""This compelling finding confirms the importance of accounting for ALSFRS-R floor effects when evaluating clinical endpoints in our phase 3 trial and may further validate the results of subgroup analyses on clinical endpoints in our Phase 3 study which minimize the ALSFRS-R floor. When the subgroup of participants above 26 are analyzed, 2 points of function are preserved on average across 28 weeks in participants treated with NurOwn compared to placebo (p<.05). Moreover, statistical modeling identified biomarkers that have the potential to predict clinical response to NurOwn observed in the trial, with markers of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection selected in the final model. Novel therapies that simultaneously target multiple pathways may offer great potential in the treatment of ALS and highlights the advantages that may come with NurOwn's ability to simultaneously modulate multiple biological pathways."" Presentation Highlights NurOwn Phase 3 Trial Patient Population and Clinical Outcomes -NurOwn's Phase 3 trial is a strong outlier compared to other late-stage ALS trials due to the inclusion of participants with more advanced disease. The average ALSFRS-R score in NurOwn's Phase 3 trial was 31, 5 points lower than the registrational trial for the most recently FDA-approved therapy. The inclusion of more advanced participants impacts the assessment of all clinical endpoints based on the ALSFRS-R, as a result of the inability to measure ongoing clinical decline with scale in these participants (i.e., a floor effect). To draw valid conclusions from clinical endpoint data collected in the trial, the floor effect must be addressed. -As previously announced, a NurOwn treatment effect was observed in participants in a pre-specified subgroup with less advanced disease (ALSFRS-R baseline score of ≥35) across two endpoints: the primary endpoint (clinical responder analysis) and a key secondary endpoint (average change from baseline to the end of the trial). The difference between NurOwn and placebo for this key secondary endpoint was nominally statistically significant (p=0.050). Biomarker Data -An analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of NurOwn and placebo on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers across pathways important to ALS of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Additional goals were to understand the role that baseline ALSFRS-R values plays on biomarker trajectories and to understand the predictive power of biomarkers on clinical outcomes. -As observed in earlier trials, NurOwn was shown to decrease biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and increase neuroprotective biomarkers over 20 weeks, demonstrating its multifaceted mechanism of action. -New analyses looked at the trajectory of biomarkers for the subgroups of participants with baseline ALSFRS-R scores >25 and <or= 25, those most likely to be impacted by the floor effect of the scale. Decreases in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative markers and increases in neuroprotective markers in NurOwn treated participants compared to placebo were observed in both subgroups. These results indicate that NurOwn had similar biological effects on ALS participants regardless of the level of disease progression at baseline. -Further statistical modeling pre-specified prior to unblinding of the data identified three biomarkers that were predictive of clinical outcomes: baseline LAP, baseline neurofilament light (NfL) and mean change in Galectin-1.

The study missed the primary efficacy endpoint, but the company said clinically meaningful responses were seen in a subgroup of patients with less severe disease... ...Study results originally published in the journal Muscle and Nerve in December 2021 show the 189-patient, placebo-controlled trial failed to meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint or on secondary endpoints. The percentage of patients in the modified intent-to-treat population who met the criteria for clinical response at week 28 for the primary endpoint was 33% in the NurOwn arm and 28% in the placebo group, (OR: 1.33, p=0.45). There also were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups on the secondary endpoints. However, in the company’s second quarter earnings release on 15 August, BrainStorm said it discovered an error in the statistical analysis around a prespecified subgroup for a secondary endpoint in the trial. The correction resulted in a statistically significant treatment difference (p = 0.05) of more than two points for an important secondary endpoint, average change from baseline in the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), in the prespecified efficacy subgroup of participants with a baseline score of at least 35, which is indicative of patients with less advanced disease... ...“The correction also relates to the other subgroup analyses published for this endpoint, demonstrating that all subgroups with ALSFRS-R baseline scores of at least 26 to 35 showed a statistically significant benefit following treatment with NurOwn (p <or= 0.050) on this secondary endpoint,” the company said... ...With the correction, the Phase III data “are stronger than originally thought as we have achieved statistical significance on a key important secondary endpoint for multiple subgroups, including the trial’s prespecified efficacy subgroup.”...

This presentation will summarize the clinical response on the primary endpoint this trial after applying two methods, ENCALS model and ALSFRS-R baseline value, to identify and minimize the impact of participant data most impacted by floor effects of the ALSFRS-R scale . Key findings: - In participants predicted by the ENCALS model to have intermediate to very long survival, a treatment effect was observed. - ENCALS model categories intermediate, long and very long, were less likely to be influenced by ALSFRS-R scale floor effect challenges. - Clinical response on the primary endpoint in participants with either a high rate of decline (ALSFRS-R slope) and low baseline ALSFRS-R values, and with ENCALS model categories very short and short survival, may have been a misclassification due to the ALSFRS-R scale floor effect, which favored the placebo group in BCT-002. - In summary, the results confirm the importance of accounting for the floor effect in more advanced and rapidly declining ALS participants to potentially avoid misclassifying treatment responses... https://ir.brainstorm-cell.com/2022-05-31-BrainStorm-Announces-Presentations-at-June-2022-Scientific-Conferences; April 2, 2022 [Subanalysis] Presented at the 74th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 2-7, 2022, Seattle, WA and April 24-26, 2022, Virtual Meeting Available online date: April 2, 2022 James Berry, Merit Cudkowicz, Robert Brown, Revital Aricha, Ralph Kern, Anthony Windebank, Nathan Staff, Namita Goyal, Robert Miller, Jonathan Katz, Matthew Burford, Yossef Levy, Chaim Lebovits, Yael Gothelf, Bruno Boulanger, Mu ...","Number of Participants Whose Disease Progression is Halted or Improved as Measured by a 100% or Greater Improvement in Post-treatment Slope vs. Pre-treatment Slope in ALSFRS-R Score of NurOwn® Treatment vs. Placebo [ Time Frame: 28 weeks following the first intrathecal injection ] The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (10 minutes) ordinal, validated rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine participants' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities.

NurOwn® (MSC-NTF Cells) Treated Patients vs. Placebo Treated Patients as Measured by the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival at 28 Weeks [ Time Frame: 28 weeks following the first intrathecal injection ] The combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) is a composite endpoint based on (1) the change from baseline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score and (2) time to death. On the ALSFRS-R, 12 functions are rated on 5-point ordinal rating scales (from 0 to 4) with a total score range (minimum and maximum score) of 0-48 (sum of all 12 items). The higher the score the better functioning. For the survival endpoint, the longer time the better outcome. A patient's CAFS score represents a patient's rank in the study based on comparing the patient's outcome for both the change in ALSFRS-R and the time to death to all other patients in the study in a pairwise fashion. The ranked scores range from 001 to 189 (the number of subjects in the mITT population) with larger rank score numbers associated with a better outcome. The reported values are the mean rank scores in each group for the composite endpoint. Secondary endpoints include safety, the percentage of patients with disease progression halted or improved, ALSFRS-R change from baseline, combined analysis of function and survival, slow vital capacity, tracheostomy-free survival, overall survival and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measurements.

During the six-month post-transplantation period, there was a decrease in the mean rate of change in ALSFRS-R and FVC compared to the three month run-in period prior to treatment. Conclusions: Simultaneous IT and IM administration of autologous MSC-NTF cells as single doses is safe and well-tolerated in ALS patients, and may slow progression in some.

The objective of the randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of a single transplantation of autologous bone-marrow derived MSC-NTF cells (NurOwn) in participants with ALS. The clinical trial enrolled 48 participants randomized 3:1 (treatment: placebo) at three leading U.S. investigative sites: Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic and University of Massachusetts Medical School. After a three-month pre-transplant run-in period, participants received one dose of MSC-NTF cells (n = 36) or placebo (n = 12) and were followed for six-months. CSF was collected prior to and two-weeks post-transplantation. The clinical trial confirmed that a single transplantation of MSC-NTF (NurOwn) cells was safe and well-tolerated... ...Key efficacy findings: - The rate of ALS disease progression (ALSFRS-R slope) was stabilized for up to 12-16 weeks in a pre-specified group of participants with rapid progression (p < 0.05) following a single transplantation - A higher proportion of MSC-NTF treated study participants experienced > or = 1.5 point/month improvement in ALSFRS-R slope at all post-treatment time points, and this was statistically significant at 4 and 12 weeks post-transplantation (p = 0.004 and 0.046, respectively) - CSF neurotrophic factors increased and inflammatory biomarkers decreased 2 weeks post-transplantation (p < 0.05) - CSF MCP-1 levels (a marker of microglial activation and neuroinflammation) significantly decreased post-transplantation and correlated with ALSFRS-R slope improvement at all time points (p < 0.05) “The entire investigative team working on the study are highly encouraged by the promising clinical results,” said Phase 2 trial manuscript lead author Robert Brown DPhil, Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and UMass Memorial Medical Center, “In addition, we observed a clear biological effect of the treatment on CSF biomarkers to support its proposed mechanism of action in ALS.” “This was a high quality Phase 2 study that identified dosing, safety, and an important efficacy signal...""... ...“The team at BrainStorm and the clinical investigators, led by Professors Brown, Cudkowicz and Windebank, have made a significant contribution to ALS research and to the peer reviewed-scientific literature with the publication of this study in Neurology,” said Ralph Kern, MD, MHSc, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Medical Officer of BrainStorm.

Brown, DPhil, MD NurOwn, phase 2, randomized, clinical trial in patients with ALS Results: The study met its primary safety endpoint. The rate of disease progression (Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale [ALSFRS-R] slope change) in the overall study population was similar in treated and placebo participants. In a prespecified rapid progressor subgroup (n = 21), rate of disease progression was improved at early time points (p < 0.05). To address heterogeneity, a responder analysis showed that a higher proportion of treated participants experienced =1.5 points/month ALSFRS-R slope improvement compared to placebo at all time points, and was significant in rapid progressors at 4 and 12 weeks (p = 0.004 and 0.046, respectively). CSF neurotrophic factors increased and CSF inflammatory biomarkers decreased in treated participants (p < 0.05) post-transplantation. CSF monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels correlated with ALSFRS-R slope improvement up to 24 weeks (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A single-dose transplantation of MSC-NTF cells is safe and demonstrated early promising signs of efficacy. This establishes a clear path forward for a multidose randomized clinical trial of intrathecal autologous MSC-NTF cell transplantation in ALS.

Brown, Jr., MD, D.Phil, Yael Gothelf Modulation of CSF Caspase-3 In MSC-NTF Cells (Nurown) In A Phase 2 ALS Study: Correlations With CSF Biomarkers and Clinical Response. Results: MCP-1 and Caspase-3 were significantly reduced post-transplantation in MSC-NTF treated participants and not in the placebo group. Expression of miR-132 was increased post -transplantation in MSC-NTF treated but not placebo participants. Baseline miR-132 was lower in non-responders compared to responders. Caspase-3 reduction was greater in responders compared to nonresponders (69% vs. 38%, p=0.03). Conclusions: Decreased CSF Caspase-3 may reflect reduced neuronal apoptosis and serve as a biomarker for neuroprotection. While MSC-NTF cells may have anti-apoptotic effects through direct paracrine NTF mechanisms such as VEGF, it is possible that indirect effects may be mediated via immunomodulation and miR-132 secretion. Caspases are known to activate microglia via NF-kB signaling1 and miR-132 may regulate apoptotic genes2. miR-132 appears to be lower in the CSF of sporadic ALS patients3 and TDP-43 is required for the biogenesis of miR-1324. These findings support the combined immunomodulatory and neuroprotective mechanism of action of MSC-NTF cells through NTF, immunomodulatory and miRNA pathways.

A higher percentage of study participants achieved > or = 1.5 points/month improvement in the treated group at all time points, was significantly higher in the treated group at 4-weeks (onesided, p=0.02) and 12-weeks (one-sided, p=0.08), and was more evident in the subgroup that excluded slow progressors (pre-treatment change ALSFRS-R > or = -2). The percentage of responders (> or = 0.375 points/month improvement) in the ALSFRS-R bulbar domain (excluding slow progressors) was significantly higher in the treated group at 4-weeks (47% vs 0, one-sided, p=0.08), 8- weeks (47% vs 0, p=0.08), 12-week (40% vs 0, p=0.09), 16-weeks (47% vs 0, one-sided, p=0.06), and 24-weeks (40% vs 0, one-sided, p=0.09). The percentage of responders (> or = 0.375 points/month improvement) in the ALSFRS-R fine motor domain (excluding slow progressors) was significantly higher in the treated group at 2-weeks (87% vs 40%, one-sided, p=0.07). A higher number of participants in the treated group demonstrated > or = 0.375 points/month improvement in gross motor and breathing domains, although these did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: The observed improvements following MSC-NTF transplantation are reflected in all four ALSFRS-R domains, particularly in the bulbar and fine motor subscales. https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAN2018/ViewPDF.asp?sbmID=2175&validate=false To Access the abstract: 1.

CSF miR- 34a, miR-376a and miR-132 baseline levels were lower in non-responder as compared to responder participants. Post-treatment CSF miR-146-5p was higher in responders, consistent with the observed decrease in CSF MCP-1. Conclusion: MSC-NTF specific miRNAs were increased in the CSF of treated but not placebo participants 2-weeks posttransplantation, suggesting continued secretory activity of MSC-NTF cells near the site of intrathecal administration. The increase of CSF miR-146 in responders, known to modulate inflammatory responses, and expression of miR-132-3p, enriched in neurons and relevant to ALS pathogenesis, supports the combined immunomodulatory and neuroprotective mechanism of action of MSC-NTF cells https://submissions.mirasmart.com/Verify/AAN2018/submission/temp/radA3F0F.pdf To Access the abstract: 1.

We also found miR-34a, miR376-a and miR-132 basal levels to be notably lower in non-responder as compared to responder patients. miR-9, which is not expressed in MSC-NTF cells, did not change significantly in either of the groups following treatment. Discussion: The increase identified in several MSC-NTF specific cell-secreted miRNAs in the CSF of treated but not placebo patients two weeks post-transplantation suggests the continued secretory activity of the MSC-NTF cells at the site of administration. The increase of miR- 146, known to mediate suppression of inflammatory response and of miR-132-3p, which is highly enriched in neurons, is highly relevant to ALS and supports the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of MSCNTF cells transplantation.

Results from Phase I Clinical Trial with Intraspinal Injection of Neural Stem Cells in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Long-Term Outcome. Results: Our results show that transplantation of hNSC is a safe procedure that causes no major deleterious effects over the short or long term. This study is the first example of medical transplantation of a highly standardized cell drug product, which can be reproducibly and stably expanded ex vivo, comprising hNSC that are not immortalized, and are derived from the forebrain of the same two donors throughout this entire study as well as across future trials. Our experimental design provides benefits in terms of enhancing both intra- and interstudy reproducibility and homogeneity. Given the potential therapeutic effects of the hNSCs Conclusions: our observations support undertaking future phase II clinical studies in which increased cell dosages are studied in larger cohorts of patients.

Results: Eighteen patients (5 females and 13 males, median age 49yrs) with definite ALS were treated. No patients manifested severe treatment related adverse events. The most common side effect was mild, post- surgical pain disappearing on average after 4 days. In 10 patients, serial MRI revealed an extradural fluid collection at the site of surgery which resolved spontaneously after 3– 6 months. No structural changes (including tumor or syrinx formation) were detected in the long term. Clinical assessments ranging from 12 to 36 months after transplantation demonstrated no evidence of acceleration of disease progression due to the treatment. Three patients of group A and 4 of groups B and C showed a transitory improvement of MRC score respectively in the leg and in the arm. Nine patients died 8–35 months after surgery due to natural history of the disease. Tacrolimus was prematurely suspended in two patients due to side effects and severe respiratory infections. Discussion and conclusions: This study confirms the procedural safety of this surgical procedure and shows no evidence of immediate or delayed toxicity related to human NSC lines from the brain tissue of single fetuses. A possible transitory benefit after treatment has also been detected. Our results support future phase II trials examining therapeutic efficacy.

Interim Results No increase of disease progression due to the treatment was observed for up to18 months after surgery. Rather, two patients showed a transitory improvement of the subscore ambulation on the ALS-FRS-R scale (from 1 to 2). A third patient showed improvement of the MRC score for tibialis anterior, which persisted for as long as 7 months. The latter and two additional patients refused PEG and invasive ventilation and died 8 months after surgery due to the progression of respiratory failure. The autopsies confirmed that this was related to the evolution of the disease. Conclusions We describe a safe cell therapy approach that will allow for the treatment of larger pools of patients for later-phase ALS clinical trials, while warranting good reproducibility. These can now be carried out under more standardized conditions, based on a more homogenous repertoire of clinical grade hNSCs.

These changes tended to shift to the baseline months after treatment but differed from the lengths of followup interval after a cycle of BM-MSCs treatment. After booster BM-MSC treatment, CSF cytokine were changed as were after 1st BM-MSC treatment. Conclusion: Shorter booster treatment intervals after a cycle of BMMSCs suggested to maintain more prominent changes of CSF cytokins after BM-MSC treatment in ALS patients. Based on these findings, Phase 3 clinical trial (ALSUMMIT) protocol were developed and recently approved by FDA. ALSUMMIT study will allow determination of the long-term efficacy and safety of multiple BM-MSCs (Lenzumestrocel) treatment.

Daga Clinical Effects of Two Intrathecal Infusions of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial in a Cohort of Brazilian Patients. Results: Among the 28 patients aged 24-69 years, two were excluded because autologous MSC did not reach required number or died after a pneumonia not related to treatment. Infusion schedule and safety analyses have been performed in all 28 subjects that attended to trial visit. Treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated over the study follow-up period. Most of the adverse effects were mild and transient, not including a treatment-related serious adverse event. Results were analyzed statically (p<0.01) and patients were stratified in responders and no responders at 30 days at 180 days post infusion, according to evaluated clinical parameters. Responder frequencies were ALSFRSr (70.4% at 30 days and 40% at 180days), FVC (60.4% at 30 days and 33.3% at 180 days), and Hand Dynamometry of right side (60% at 30 days and 40.9% at 180 days) and left side (57.7% at 30 days and 31.8% at 180 days). Patients were also stratified according BDNF, HGF, FGF-2, CNTF among other deregulated (p<0.05) proteins in CSF 30 days after infusion. Furthermore, levels of neurotrophic molecules in ALS MSC were higher (p<0.05) than levels found in MSC of adipose tissue of normal subjects or post-mortem spinal cords of subjects without history of neurodegenerative disease. Conclusions: Intrathecal infusions of MSC in patients with ALS were safe and provide indications of possible clinical benefits in responder subjects. Clinicalmolecular correlations in the responder ALS patients could be of potential interest.

Results: Higher gene expression of seven studied molecules BDNF, FGF-2, GDNF, HGF, NTF-3, PEDF and VEGF was found in BM MSC of ALS patients compared to AT MSC (BDNF (76%, p<0.05), GDNF (91%, p<0.01), HGF (97%, p<0.01), NTF-3 (79%, p<0.01), VEGF (38%, p<0.01)] or spinal cord (post-mortem) of health subjects (BDNF (91%, p<0.01), FGF-2 (65%, p<0.05), PEDF (95%, p<0.01), VEGF (97%, p<0.01)], being BDNF and VEGF levels higher in both comparisons. Gene expression rations of AN/ALS BM MSC were 43% (BDNF), 150% (FGF-2), 15% (GDNF), 7.5% (NTF-3), 2% (HGF) and 28% (PEDF). Moreover, BDNF, FGF-2 and HGF proteins in the conditioned medium of cultured BM MSC of health subjects were higher than BM MSC ALS. Conclusions: The BM MSC applied in the autologous infusions of 27 ALS patients of the phase 1/2 clinical trial synthesized higher levels neurotrophic factors for MN compared to other cells. Further analyses must be addressed in order to correlate the levels of neurotrophic factors to the clinical responses of study enrolled patients.

Daga, Giuseppe Palmisano Safety And Clinical Effects Of Two Intrathecal Infusions Of Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Preliminary Results Of A Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial In A Cohort Of Brazilian Patients Interim Results: Among the 28 patients aged 24-69 years, one was excluded because MSC did not reach required number. Infusion schedule and safety analyses have been performed in all 27 remaining subjects. Treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated over the study follow-up period on 77.7% patients that have completed the program until June 2018. Most of the adverse effects were mild and transient, not including an treatment-related serious adverse event. Considering the 77.7% completed program by June 2018, patients were stratified (p50.05) in responders and no responders according to evaluated clinical parameters (responder frequency) ie ALSFRSr (33%), Hand Dynamometry (44/62%, R/L Hands), Isometric Strength (2244%, depending on side of muscle groups of superior and inferior limbs). CVF parameters are still under analysis. High resolution mass spectrometry identified more than 600 proteins. Label-free quantification and statistical analysis revealed potential biomarker candidates and patient stratification. Conclusions: The results suggest that 2 intrathecal infusions of MSC in patients with ALS is safe and provide indications of possible clinical benefits in responder subjects. Clinical-molecular correlations in the responder ALS patients could be of potential interest.

In patients who had ALS with an inherently slow course, there were no significant changes in the rate of disease progression. In patients who had ALS with an inherently rapid course, slowing of the disease was noted following treatment with MSCs. However, because that subgroup was so small, it was not possible to assess whether the changes were statistically significant. Conclusions Identifying groups of patients who are not responding or potentially responding negatively to injection of MSCs may help prevent it from being offered to individuals who may not benefit from the therapy. One of the limitations of this treatment method is the amount of time required for long-lasting preparation of bone marrow-derived MSCs for a disease that is rapidly progressive. Therefore, it is worth looking for other allogeneic sources of stromal cells for these types of injections. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301428/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7737405/",,NCT02881489 TrialTroveID-285529 UWM/ALS-MSC.2015/002 UwmBmmscALS,"Primary Outcome Measures: Changes in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) between patients before and after stem cell transplantation.

Intramuscular Injection of Bone Marrow Stem Cells in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. RESULTS: Our results show that (1) the intramuscular injection of BMMCs is a safe procedure; (2) ALS patients show heterogeneities in the degree of TA injury; (3) a comparison of placebo-injected muscles with BMMC-injected muscles showed significant differences in only one parameter, the D50 index used to quantify the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) scan curve. This parameter was higher in the BMMC-injected TA muscle at both 90 days (placebo side: 29.55 +/- 2.89, n = 20; experimental side: 39.25 +/- 3.21, n = 20; p < 0.01) and 180 days (placebo side: 29.35 +/- 3.29, n = 17; experimental side: 41.24 +/- 3.34, n = 17; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This procedure had no effect on the TA muscle MU properties, with the exception of the D50 index. Finding differences in just this index supports the fact that it may be much more sensitive than other electrophysiological parameters when studying treatment effects. Given the low number of patients and their heterogeneity, these results justify exploring the efficacy of this procedure in further patients and other muscles, through Phase II trials.

Preliminary Results Of A Phase I Clinical Trial Interim Results: 18 patients have been included. A mean of 504x106 (206x106 - 1.058x106 ) BM-MNC were infused. With a mean follow up of 156 days (30-335), 5 procedure-related non-severe adverse events have been registered. All of them were CTCAE grade 1-2 and resolved before day +5. There also have been 5 non procedure-related serious adverse events. In the 14 patients that have reached the day+90 follow-up, there were no differences in the evolution of the dynamometer-measured TA strength between both legs. Conclusion: The procedure is safe and feasible. Neither major complications nor morbidities related to the procedure have been observed.

Correlate the maximum force of isometric contraction muscle and muscle morphology (obtained from ultrasound) with the estimated number of motor units in the evolution of patients with ALS. Secondary end point(s): Neurological variables: Assessment of motor function. The muscle force data are collected according to the scale of the Medical Research Council (1943). Muscle strength is graded on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being normal muscle strength and 0 absence of muscle contraction. Sonographic variables: - Presence of local complications related to the process (edema, abscesses, muscle necrosis, etc.): Yes / No Maximum transverse area of both TA muscles. The ultrasound study was performed using a linear probe of 12 to 15 MHz These assessments will be made in the times that are specified in the protocol: at baseline, at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days of infusion Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: Variables Neurological Evaluation of the TA muscle motor function of both lower limbs using the MRC scale. Ultrasound Variables: Analysis of the TA muscle of both legs to assess muscle mass and maximum cross-sectional area, analyzing the appearance of edema, abscess, or necrosis. Secondary Outcome Measures: Estimated number of motor units (MUNE) [ Time Frame: 24 months from baseline ] Several techniques for estimating the MUNE, all based on the relationship between the amplitude or area of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and amplitude or area corresponding to a single motor unit response. The differences between the techniques are due to the different ways of estimating the amplitude of the responses for individual motor units. The study will use two techniques: Incremental Technique: The unitary amplitude (or area) of individual motor units are calculated from the responses to increasing intensities stimuli near of intensity threshold (Dantes and McComas, 1991) Statistical technique: The unit amplitude (or area) of the individual motor units are calculated from the amplitude variations (or area) of the muscle action potential obtained in response to stimuli from a fixed intensity (Daube, 2006) Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) [ Time Frame: 24 months from baseline ] CMAP is registered after supramaximal stimulation intensity (0.1-0.2 ms pulses at 1 Hz) of the common peroneal nerve at the level of the head of the fibula. The electrical stimulus is placed in a fixed position during the entire registration process. CMAP will be recorded simultaneously in 5 positions along longitudinally oriented TA muscle. To determine these 5 positions bony landmarks that are reproducible between members and between different patients will be used. Fiber density (FD) [ Time Frame: 24 months from baseline ] Quantifies the average number of muscle fibers per motor unit. It is obtained from single fiber recordings made with electrodes. The average number of motor unit potentials is calculated in 20 different positions in the muscle.

Results: On the basis of the VHI scores, the entire cohort was divided into 2 groups: group I (40 subjects) with mild speech impairment, and group II (23 subjects) displaying moderate and profound speech deficits. In an early phase of ALS, changes were typically reported in the tongue, lips and soft palate. The FDA and VHI-based measurements revealed a high, positive correlation between the objective and subjective evaluation of articulation quality. Conclusions: Deterioration of the articulatory organs resulted in the reduction of social, physical and emotional functioning. The highly positive correlation between the VHI and FDA scales seems to indicate that the VHI questionnaire may be a reliable, self-contained tool for monitoring the course and progression of speech disorders in ALS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629403 (Full Text Available at Source URL) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6800986/ https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-019-1484-2",Secondary Outcome Measures: Efficacy of autologous bone marrow stem/progenitor cell infusion in enrolled patients.

Kim ,Min Young Noh, Goang Won Cho, Won-Ki Paek, Seong-Ho Koh, Hyun Young Kim Outcomes of autologous bone marrow stem cell therapy in ALS patients and analysis of factors affecting prognosis of stem cell therapy: Current status and future directions of stem cell therapy for ALS patients. Results: During the follow-up period, MSCs treatment yielded a significant lesser change of ALSFRS-R score, compared to control group (1.54 vs 3.56, p<0.01).Moreover, the slop of decline of ALSFRS-R was significantly lower during the follow-up period, compared to the lead-in period in MSCs treatment group (2.68 vs 1.54, p=0.04), whereas the slopes during the two periods were not different in the control group. And, we analyzed characteristics of ALS stem cells focusing on their potential secretary capacity of neurotrophic factors and factors related with stem cell migration . We identified significant reductions in the expression of Oct-4 and Nanog, and in the trophic factors ANG, FGF-2, HGF, IGF-1, PIGF, SDF-1a, TGF-ß, and VEGF, but not in BDNF or ECGF. Migration of ALS-SCs was reduced, although the cells expressed the same markers for human mesenchymal phenotypes. Conclusion: These data suggest that autologous stem cell therapy can be an alternative potential therapeutic strategy, however ALS patients originated stem cell have some limitation in the issue of secretary and migratory capacity. Therefore, allogenic stem cell therapy or other genetic modifying therapy would be next promising strategy for stem cell therapy for ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. http://www.neuro.or.kr/workshop/abstract/admin/schedule8/view_abstract.php?abstract_year=2010_1&number=29O10138",Additional clinical findings after treatment were all collected for secondary outcome measure and safety.,TrialTroveID-137610,Disease status of patients were analyzed with ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) for primary outcome measure.,,Safety and Tolerability,137610,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,Ii,,4,6,1,0,0,0,11,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Neurotrophic Bone Marrow Cellular Nests Prevent Spinal Motoneuron Degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients: A Pilot Safety Study Results: Eleven patients were included. We did not observe any severe transplant-related adverse event, but there were 43 nonsevere events. Twenty-two (51%) resolved in <or=2 weeks and only four were still present at the end of follow-up. All were common terminology criteria for adverse events grade <or=2. No acceleration in the rate of decline of FVC, ALS-FRS, Norris, or MRC scales was observed. Four patients died on days 359, 378, 808, and 1,058 post-transplant for reasons unrelated to the procedure. Spinal cord pathological analysis showed a greater number of motoneurons in the treated segments compared with the untreated segments (4.2+or- 0.8 motoneurons per section [mns per sect] and 0.9 +or-0.3 mns per sect, respectively). In the treated segments, motoneurons were surrounded by CD90+ cells and did not show degenerative ubiquitin deposits. Conclusions: This clinical trial confirms not only the safety of intraspinal infusion of autologous BMNC in ALS patients but also provides evidence strongly suggesting their neurotrophic activity. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22415951 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.1080/abstract Full text is available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.1080/pdf; March 30, 2009 Presented at the 35th Annual Meeting of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, March 29 - April 1, 2009, Göteborg, Sweden Abstract No: P 702 M.

Moraleda Phase I-II clinical trial on the use of bone marrow mononuclear cells in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nine-month follow-up. Interim Results: Seven patients have been infused so far. Median time from diagnosis to cellular infusion was 20 months. We infused a total of 402 x106 (240-602.8) MNC, including 3.16 x106 (0.96-10.25) CD34+ cells. After 9 months of follow-up, assessment of the FVC's evolution and the score points of the international ALS-FRS, Norris and MRC scales, revealed that of two rapidly evolving patients, one achieved stabilization of the progression and one was unaffected by the intervention. Five patients whose disease evolved more slowly also achieved stabilization of the functional scales or maintained basal FVC values. Serial MRI studies did not show any spinal cord damage. There were two severe adverse reactions (AE): 1 syncope secondary to constipation, and 1 high tract respiratory infection. AEs of WHO grade 1 or 2 and less than 2 months of duration were: constipation, intercostal pain, CSF hypotension and lower limbs paresthesias (1 of them persistent). After 9 months of follow-up, all patients had asymptomatic abolition of the somato-sensorial potentials of the posterior tract. Conclusions: The procedure was safe and feasible. No major complications or significant morbility were observed. Stabilization of the disease was achieved in 6 of the first 7 patients included in the protocol. http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=81106&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=91&XNMASKEN_ID=900","Secondary Outcome Measures ALS-FRS, MRC and Norris scales [Time Frame: Every 3 months] .

No major side effects were reported during a follow up period of up to 25 months. The mean ALSFRS remained stable during the 6 first months of observation, whereas the mean EDSS score improved from 6.71.05 to 5.91.6 at 6 months. MR imaging clearly visualized the MSCs in the occipital horns of the ventricles at 24 hours post injection. and indicated a possible migration of Feridex-labeled cells in the meninges, the subarhachnoid space and the spinal cord parenchyma. Immunological analysis in 12 of the patients, revealed a 72% increase in the proportion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, a 63% decrease in the proliferative responses of lymphocytes (accompanied by a reduction in the IFNg and IL-17 production) and a 30-60% reduction of CD40, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR expression on myeloid dendritic cells, at 24hrs following MSC transplantation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that intrathecal and intravenous injection of MSC in patients with MS and ALS, is a clinically feasible and relatively safe procedure. MSC treatment resulted in immediate immunomodulatory effects. Further controlled studies and longer observation periods are needed to evaluate the long term safety and the potential clinical efficacy of MSC treatment.

Results: The in vitro expanded MSCs did not show any bacterial o fungal contamination, hemopoietic cell contamination, chromosomic alterations and early cellular senescence. No patient manifested major adverse events such as respiratory failure or death. Minor adverse events were intercostal pain irradiation and leg sensory dysesthesia, both reversible after a mean period of 6 weeks. No modification of the spinal cord volume or other signs of abnormal cell proliferation were observed. A significant slowing down of the linear decline of the forced vital capacity was evident in four patients 36 months after MSCs transplantation. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that direct injection of autologous expanded MSCs into the spinal cord of ALS patients is safe, with no significant acute or late toxicity, and well tolerated.

LONDON — APRIL 15, 2024 — AviadoBio, a pioneering gene therapy company dedicated to developing and delivering potentially transformative medicines for neurodegenerative disorders, today announced that the first patient has been treated in the Phase 1/2 ASPIRE-FTD trial evaluating AviadoBio’s investigational gene therapy, AVB-101, in people with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with progranulin (GRN) gene mutations (FTD-GRN). Clinical trial sites are currently open in Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands with additional sites expected to open in multiple countries, including the United States. “AviadoBio is committed to bringing forward an innovative gene therapy treatment for FTD-GRN and this moment marks an important milestone for the FTD community and our company,” said Lisa Deschamps, CEO. “We are thankful for the dedication of the ASPIRE-FTD clinical investigators studying AVB-101 and immensely grateful for the families who participate in clinical trials for new treatment options that may change the future for generations of families living with FTD-GRN.” FTD is a devastating form of early-onset dementia that typically leads to death within three to 10 years from diagnosis.¹,² People with FTD commonly experience personality changes, behavioral disturbance, loss of language, apathy, and reduced mobility.³ It is a leading cause of dementia in people under the age of 65 and is often misdiagnosed.⁴People with FTD who have disease-causing GRN mutations produce a reduced amount of progranulin protein. AVB-101 is a potential one-time therapy designed to stop disease progression by delivering a functional copy of the GRN gene to restore appropriate progranulin levels to affected areas of the brain. “There is a critical need for new treatments for people living with FTD-GRN. The lack of effective disease-modifying treatments makes this diagnosis particularly difficult for patients and their families who don’t currently have any available treatment options for this devastating and progressive disease,” said David Cooper, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. “Treating the first patient in ASPIRE-FTD marks an important step forward in understanding AVB-101’s potential, which has already shown promise in preclinical studies.” AVB-101 is delivered using a minimally invasive, stereotactic neurosurgical procedure directly to the part of the brain called the thalamus. The thalamus has extensive connections to other parts of the brain, including the frontal and temporal lobes, which play a critical role in FTD and the symptoms that impact patients and their families. This targeted delivery method aims to safely and effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, delivering targeted treatment directly to the brain to restore progranulin levels in the frontal and temporal cortex where it is needed most, while at the same time minimizing the dose required and thereby limiting any potential systemic exposure. The Interventional Neurotherapy Center (INC) at Mazowiecki Szpital Bródnowski Hospital is the first and only center in Europe currently performing MRI-guided infusions of gene therapies. “Our team is excited to participate in this important scientific research and to perform the first intrathalamic administration of AVB-101 in the ASPIRE-FTD global trial,” said Prof. Mirosław Ząbek, M.D., Ph.D., the chairperson of the department of neurosurgery at INC. “As a neurologist and founder of the Neuro-Care Clinic, I’ve seen the difficult struggles of my patients with dementia and their families,” said Gabriela Klodowska, M.D., Ph.D. “It means a lot to our patients with FTD to bring this type of study offering a potential one-time treatment for patients with a GRN mutation to Poland and to be the first to enroll patients in this global study.” In November 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to AVB-101. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This designation is intended to bring new medicines to patients earlier. It has also received orphan drug designation by both the FDA and European Commission.

Mean FIM changed from 82.5 to 84.1. One patient did not go on a permanent baclofen pump because swallowing and gait deteriorated under ITB, another patient because ADL and transfers did not improve. Discussion and Conclusions: The pattern of muscle tone and strength varies substantially and individually in MND patients. Therefore definition of therapeutic targets with the patient and carers is crucial before starting ITB, considering especially swallowing, speech, gait, ADL, head and trunk stability, pain, positioning, transfers. A reliable evaluation requires determination of reproducible items, consistency of investigators and setting, and adequate time period. ITB is effective but not always beneficial in MND. We recommend analysis of the usefulness of ITB by means of a temporary external pump in an experienced interdisciplinary in-house rehabilitation team. This setting provides an adequate time frame and information level for patients, carers, and professionals to define if placement of a permanent ITB pump is indicated.

The mean ALSFRS-R and FVC values remained stable during the first 3 months of the treatment. However, a significant reduction in ALSFRS-R and FVC levels was observed in these patients 6 months after BM-MSCs administration. Our study revealed that the concurrent IT and IV application of BM-MSCs in patients with ALS is a safe procedure. Furthermore, our data indicate a temporary delay in the progression of ALS after a single combined IT and IV administration of BM-MSCs. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the IT and IV transplantation of BM-MSCs in ALS patients is a safe procedure and could slow down the progression of the disease. To confirm the most effective methods of delivery and suitable doses in single or repeated applications of BM-MSCs treatment, further clinical investigations with more patients and longer follow-up periods as well as with the repetitive application of BM-MSCs are required. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34466632/ Full text available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377537/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377537/pdf/main.pdf",,IRCT20160809029275N2 TrialTroveID-402477,"Primary outcomes 1 Description Earned score based on ALS-FRS test Timepoint Before, 1 and 3 months after injection of mesenchymal stem cells Method of measurement Standard Questionnaire 2 Description Evaluation of serum levels of cytokines, IL-1 beta, TNF-a, IL-10, IFN-lambda Timepoint Before, 1 and 3 months after injection of mesenchymal stem cells Method of measurement Using Elisa method 3 Description FVC measurement Timepoint Before, 1 and 3 months after injection of mesenchymal stem cells Method of measurement Using Spirometery test 4 Description Evaluation of TCD4 + CD25 + lymphocyte cells.

No DLTs were observed up to 300 mg QD, but DLTs were observed in 3/3 patients of the 400 mg QD cohort. In all patients receiving 100 mg-400 mg, the prevalent adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal AEs in 12 patients (92.3%), liver function related AEs in 7 patients (53.8%), and rash in 3 patients (23.1%). The safety profile was consistent with that known for CML treatment, and ALS-specific AEs were not observed. A subset of patients (5/9 patients) was found to respond well to bosutinib treatment over the 12-week treatment period. It was found that the treatment-responsive patients could be distinguished by their lower levels of plasma NFL. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived motor neurons revealed the pathogenesis related molecular signature in patients with ALS showing responsiveness to bosutinib. Interpretation: This is the first trial of a Src/c-Abl inhibitor, bosutinib, for patients with ALS. The safety and tolerability of bosutinib up to 300 mg, not 400 mg, in ALS were described, and responsiveness of patients on motor function was observed. Since this was an open-label trial within a short period with a limited number of patients, further clinical trials will be required. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36467452/ Full text https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/36467452/ https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589-5370(22)00437-0 https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2589-5370%2822%2900437-0; November 17, 2021 [Interim Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 22, Issue supplement 2, November 2021 Presented at the 32nd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 7-10, 2021, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2021 Abstract No. CLT-16 K.

Inoue Clinical trial of bosutinib for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: induced pluripotent stem cell-based drug repurposing for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis medicine (iDReAM) study Results: A total of 20 participants were enrolled, 13 of whom received bosutinib treatment, and 12 were included in the safety and efficacy analyses. No DLTs were observed up to 300 mg QD, but three DLTs (two cases of Grade 3 aspartate and alanine aminotransferase increase, one case of disseminated erythematous papular) were observed in the 400 mg QD cohort. The safety profile was consistent with what is known for CML treatment, and neither new safety signals nor ALS-specific adverse events were observed. Although the study was conducted with a small number of cases, bosutinib administration was found to halt progression in some of the participants, and 5 of 9 patients who had completed the administration of scheduled doses of bosutinib showed stable disease. Furthermore, a biomarker was found to enrich the target population showing a strong drug effect. Conclusions: This study showed that bosutinib administration up to 300 mg QD was safe and well tolerated, with promising efficacy for motor symptoms in ALS.

After completion of the protocol intervention, 29% of the AD population yielded decreased CDR scores while only 8% of PDD patients had decreased CDR scores. Discussion: These results continue to warrant further investigation of bosutinib as a potential therapeutic agent for dementia. The data continue to suggest an overall positive or stable outcome among participants after a year of bosutinib, with a clinical improvement rate of approximately 40% and a 38% rate of clinical stabilization. This observation remains consistent regardless of severity of cognitive impairment at baseline.

Scott Pereles, Mike Whitney, Taylor Kuhn Treatment of Dementia With Bosutinib: An Open-Label Study of a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Results: The present article reports on cognitive outcomes obtained at 12 months for 31 participants and up to 24 months for a 16-participant subset. Safety and tolerability of bosutinib were confirmed among the study population (Mage = 73.7 years, SDage = 14 years). Bosutinib was associated with less worsening in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (hazard ratio = -0.62, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.02 to -0.30) and less decline in RBANS performance (hazard ratio = -3.42, p < 0.001, 95% CI: -3.59 to -3.72) during the year of treatment than population-based estimates of decline. In the 24-month follow-up, wherein 16 patients were observed after 1 year postintervention, 31.2% of participants exhibited worsened CDR levels compared with their 12-month performances. Conclusions: Results support an overall positive outcome after 1 year of bosutinib. Future studies should explore the relationship between tyrosine kinases and neurodegenerative pathology as well as related avenues of treatment. https://cp.neurology.org/content/11/3/e294",,062016 NCT02921477 TrialTroveID-287785,Primary Outcome Measures: Number of patients who are discontinued due to tolerability issues related to treatment [ Time Frame: 1 year ] Outcome goal to determine safety and tolerability of study medication,,,287785,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,I,,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Results: Sudomotor function and blood pressure response to handgrip significantly worsened during the treatment period (55.4 + or -26.1 vs. 38.9 + or - 23.9 g/m(2)h, p<0.05; 20+ or - 6 vs. 13 + or - 4 microHg, p<0.05) whereas other sympathetic and all parasympathetic function tests only tended to be more abnormal at follow-up. Serum norepinephrine levels increased significantly during the nine-months observation period. The results of autonomic function tests were not different between patients treated with BDNF and placebo, but norepinephrine levels were higher in the BDNF group. Conclusions: We conclude that autonomic nervous system function deteriorates along with poorer motor performance independently from treatment with BDNF.

Bromocriptine Mesylate Attenuates Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Research in Japanese Patients. RESULTS: Statistics analyses revealed a marginal BRC treatment efficacy with P?20%to placebo by 1st and 2nd endpoint analysis. In the 1st endpoint analysis, BRC group was significantly effective on the scores of ALSAQ40-communicaton (P = 1.2%), eating and drinking (P = 2.2%), ALSFRS-R total (P = 17.6%), grip strength (P = 19.8%) compared to the placebo group. In the 2nd endpoint analysis, differences between the scores of Limb Norris Scale (P = 18.3%), ALSAQ40-communication (P = 11.9%), eating and drinking (P = 13.6%), and neck forward-bent test (P = 15.4%) of BRC group were detected between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for adverse events or serious drug reactions incidence. CONCLUSIONS: BRC sustains motoneuronal function at least in part through BRC treatment.

Median survival duration was 10.39 months longer in PB&TURSO-randomized participants from CENTAUR (23.54 months) versus historical controls (13.15 months; HR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.31–0.72; P=.00048). Conclusions: The results of this analysis suggest a greater survival benefit with PB&TURSO than seen on ITT analysis in CENTAUR. The survival benefit attributed to PB&TURSO in this analysis aligns with prior analyses using statistical models controlling for placebo-to-active crossover in CENTAUR. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-001382.html; July 2006 Ann Neurol. 2006 Jul;60(1):22-31 Received: February 9, 2006; Revised: April 26, 2006; Accepted: April 28, 2006; Published online June 26, 2006 Trial of celecoxib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Results: Celecoxib did not slow the decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, motor unit number estimates, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or affect survival. Celecoxib was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased frequency of adverse events. Prostaglandin E(2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid were not elevated at baseline and did not decline with treatment. Interpretation: At the dosage studied, celecoxib did not have a beneficial effect on research subjects with ALS, and it was safe. A biological effect of celecoxib was not demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid. Further studies of celecoxib at a dosage of 800 mg/day in ALS are not warranted. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16802291?dopt=Abstract http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112660988/abstract?

Kazantseva Treatment of ALS by Means of Minimized Curative Compression in the Chamber with Cyclosporine A. Results: Pure Curative compression in the chamber led to improvement of the bulbar disturbances (phonation, swallowing) without marked improvement of the movement. The use of Cyclosporine A in combination with the barochamber sessions was accompanied by clearly more significant regress of the neurological symptoms and by increase of the muscle mass and enhancement of the muscle power. After the barochamber treatment with Cyclosporine A the normalization of the immune status and the decrease of CD95 were also observed. Conclusions: A curative effect of the combined use of cyclosporine A and minimized treatment in a chamber may be based on the restoration of microcirculation and on the improved cyclosporine A delivery for retarding apoptosis. http://www.kenes.com/adpd2009/posters/Abstract880.htm",,TrialTroveID-105840,,,,105840,,,,Ii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd. (Nasdaq: NRSN) (""NeuroSense""), a company developing treatments for severe neurodegenerative diseases, today reports additional positive data from its six-month double-blind Phase 2b PARADIGM trial of NeuroSense's lead drug candidate PrimeC for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (""ALS""). The PARADIGM trial's secondary clinical efficacy outcome measure endpoints included Quality of Life and Survival. Consistent with the previously reported results, PrimeC displayed a clinically meaningful effect on various aspects of patients' quality of life, including mental and physical health. Moreover, analyses pertaining to survival outcomes emphasized the implications of PrimeC intervention in mitigating disease progression and burden. PrimeC achieved an improvement in complication-free survival compared to placebo (in several methodologies, including MiToS and King's Advanced Stage-free Survival), reducing the risk of ALS disease complications or death by up to 53%. These survival analyses observe time from participant randomization to death from any cause or respiratory insufficiency (defined as tracheostomy or the use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation for over 22 hours per day for 10 or more consecutive days), or time to hospitalization due to ALS-related complications or advancements in MiToS or King's stages. This news comes on the heels of the recent positive top-line results reported in December 2023 from the PARADIGM trial in 68 participants, which met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, establishing a robust safety profile of PrimeC. In addition, PrimeC demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of disease progression with a 37.4% (p=0.03) difference in the gold standard ALS tracking measure, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (""ALSFRS-R""), in favor of PrimeC vs placebo, and 17.2% (p=0.39) difference in Slow Vital Capacity (""SVC"") in favor of PrimeC vs placebo, based on the pre-specified Per Protocol (PP) population analysis. The PP analysis population includes all participants who adhered to the trial protocol and treatment plan without any major protocol deviations and includes 62 patients (43 active and 19 placebo). About PARADIGM PARADIGM is a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b (NCT05357950) clinical trial of PrimeC in ALS. The trial included 68 participants living with ALS in Canada, Italy, and Israel. 96% of the trial participants who completed the 6-month double-blind portion of the trial chose to receive treatment with PrimeC through a 12-month open label extension. Furthermore, to date all participants that completed the 18-month trial treatment duration, requested to continue PrimeC, which is provided to them in an Investigator Initiated Trial, not limited with time. An analysis of the ITT top-line data from the 6-month double-blind segment of the trial showed clinically meaningful signs of efficacy with a 29% difference in ALSFRS-R (p=0.12) and a 13% difference in SVC (p=0.5), both in favor of PrimeC vs placebo. These data include all 68 people living with ALS enrolled in Canada, Italy, and Israel, with the exclusion of one patient who was misdiagnosed. Most patients enrolled in both the active and placebo arms of trial were concurrently treated with Riluzole, the ALS standard of care medication, indicating PrimeC slowed disease progression well beyond the level afforded by the FDA approved ALS drug. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurosense-reports-additional-positive-results-from-its-als-phase-2b-paradigm-trial-302067299.html; February 18, 2024 ADPD 2024 Available online date: February 18, 2024 Abstract No. P1221 / #1553 Shiran Salomon-Zimri, Nitai Kerem, Tiziana Petrozziello, Gabriel Linares, Niva Russek-Blum, Andrew Thompson, Jacob Harris, Jin Xu, Nicole Wong, Craig Lawless, Martin Bachman, Ernestas Sirka, Meitar Grad, Guy Shapira, Noam Shomron, Justin Ichida, Ghazaleh Sadri-Vakili, Ferenc Tracik SHIFTING THE PARADIGM - A BIOMARKER DRIVEN APPROACH FOR STUDYING AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) THERAPY ACTIVITY Results would elucidate PrimeC’s effects on target biomarkers and miRNAs, and their correlation with clinical outcomes and efficacy.

Drory CORRELATION BETWEEN OCULOMETRIC MEASURES AND CLINICAL ASSESSMENT IN ALS PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN A PHASE IIB CLINICAL DRUG TRIAL Results: A moderate correlation was found between ALSFRS-R and corrective saccadic latency (R=0.52, p=0.002). Fixation time during smooth pursuit and peak velocity during pro-saccade were both worse in ALS patients versus healthy subjects (mean (SD)=0.34(0.06) vs. 0.3(0.07), p=0.01, and 0.41(0.05) vs. 0.38(0.07), p=0.04, respectively). Patients with bulbar symptoms (n=14) had a decreased pro-saccade gain compared with patients without bulbar symptoms (mean (SD)=0.1 (0.04) vs. 0.93 (0.07), p=0.01), and a larger error rate of anti-saccade movement (mean (SD)=0.42 (0.21) vs. 0.28 (0.16), p=0.04). Conclusion: Oculometric measures correlated with the clinical assessment and were different from data of healthy subjects. Further studies are warranted to establish the role of oculometrics in the evaluation of patients with ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders, and its possible use in clinical trials. https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/wcn23/attendee/confcal/show/session/66; June 27, 2022 [Press release] NeuroSense Therapeutics Reports Positive Results from Stage III ALS Biomarker Study Preliminary results show levels of disease-related biomarkers remain unchanged in people living with ALS who are treated with standard of care, in contrast to the statistically significant decline in these biomarkers in patients treated in NeuroSense's Phase IIa study with PrimeC New biomarker data in people with ALS validates NeuroSense's clinical strategy CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd. (NASDAQ: NRSN) (""NeuroSense""), a company developing treatments for severe neurodegenerative diseases, today announced results from Stage III of its biomarker study conducted in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to evaluate PrimeC, NeuroSense's lead combination drug candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PrimeC is currently being evaluated in NeuroSense's Phase IIb PARADIGM study following the successful conclusion of its Phase IIa study which met its primary endpoints. The purpose of the initial ALS biomarker study (Stage I) was to characterize the baseline phenomena observed in people living with ALS. The study identified novel ALS biomarkers that are indicative of PrimeC's mechanism of action (MOA), via an analysis comparing blood samples obtained from healthy people and from people living with ALS. TDP-43 accumulation and neuroinflammation via prostagladin2 were amongst the disease-modifying targets characterized, along with miRNA dysregulation, iron accumulation, lysosomal dysfunction, and impaired autophagy. Stage II investigated the therapeutic effect of PrimeC. In NeuroSense's Phase IIa study, blood samples were analyzed to determine the longitudinal effect of PrimeC on the biomarkers identified in Stage I. Following 12 months of administration with PrimeC, statistically significant changes in key ALS-related biomarkers were observed in study participants. Furthermore, the study established a correlation between the clinically meaningful outcomes detected and modulations in those biomarkers. The Stage III natural history study analyzed blood samples from people living with ALS, treated with standard of care. Preliminary results show that levels of disease-related biomarkers remain steady and unchanged in people living with ALS, in contrast to the statistically significant decline portrayed in these biomarkers when PrimeC was administered in addition to the standard of care. Stage III results further confirmed PrimeC's MOA, and expanded insight into ALS-related biomarkers and their correlation to the progression of ALS symptoms. ""These results are very encouraging, especially in that they validate NeuroSense's clinical strategy. The biomarker study, along with the data we collect from our Phase IIb study, will inform the optimization of a pivotal Phase III study of PrimeC in ALS,"" stated NeuroSense's CEO, Alon Ben-Noon.

None of these AEs were unexpected, and most were mild or moderate (69%). Additionally, no serious AEs were related to the study drug. One participant tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered without complications, and no other abnormal laboratory investigations were found. Participants’ survival compared to their predictions showed no safety concerns. Biomarker analyses demonstrated significant changes associated with PrimeC in neural-derived exosomal TDP-43 levels and levels of LC3, a key autophagy marker. Interpretation: This study supports the safety and tolerability of PrimeC in ALS. Biomarker analyses suggest early evidence of a biological effect. A placebo-controlled trial is required to disentangle the biomarker results from natural progression and to evaluate the efficacy of PrimeC for the treatment of ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36106817/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2022.2119868; March 21, 2022 [Press release] NeuroSense Therapeutics Receives FDA Clearance of IND for PrimeC for the Treatment of ALS - PrimeC, a novel combination therapy, demonstrated efficacy and safety in Phase IIa study ...PrimeC was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Drory Breaking The Paradigm –Primec As A Novel Therapeutic Approach To Neurodegeerative Disease Results: demonstrate that PrimeC was safe and tolerable in the ALS patient population. These findings were reinforced by encouraging clinical signals when utilizing numerous virtual control models (Origentprediction-models, ENCALS-survival-prediction model, and PRO-ACT) as a novel approach to control arms in early phase, open-label studies. These results were accompanied by significant changes in ALSrelated biomarkers of serum neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) such as TDP-43 and LC3, indicating a positive biological activity. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that PrimeC is safe and well-tolerated. These findings in conjunction with the biological activity observed in biomarkers analysis set the stage for a larger, placebocontrolled study. Importantly, since the aforementioned pathologies are shared between neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesize that PrimeC may serve as a therapeutic agent for indications, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's.

These findings were reinforced by several virtual models (i.e Origent and ENCALS prediction models, and matched patients from the PRO-ACT database), which showed no safety concerns with regards to patient adverse events and survival. Additionally, the effect of PrimeC on serum neurofilament levels, as well as on neuronal extracellular vesicle (EVs) key ALS-related biomarkers was examined by extracting EVs from patient serum samples. Results exhibited significant change in exosomal-TDP-43 following PrimeC treatment, accompanied by a similar effect on the key autophagy marker LC3. Discussion: The present study demonstrates that PrimeC is safe and well-tolerated. Of significance, all patients completing the trial have opted to continue into an extension study with PrimeC. These safety findings in conjunction with the biological activity observed in biomarkers analysis, set the stage for a larger, placebo-controlled, pivotal study to examine the efficacy of PrimeC in ALS treatment.

There were no cutaneous or mucosal reactions. The blood sample showed no negative changes of blood count, liver or kidney function or signs of inflammation. The questionaire revealed no symptoms related to the CDP-choline treatment. There was no measurable interaction in the patients with combined CDP-cholone and riluzole therapy. One patient complained of a headache but showed progressive sleep related hypoxic periods. The headache disappeared after ventilatory assistance. One patient had a gastrointestinal infection in the observed time interval, but tolerated CDP-choline well before and after the infection. All but the one patient with the headache summarized the treatment with CDP-choline as positive and wished to be included in the following efficacy pilot study. Discussion and Conclusions: CDP-choline was safe and well-tolerated in a small number of patients with MND in a short time period of observation. This result is in accordance with the data from CDP-choline studies in acute stroke. Furthermore a dual glutamate exitotoxicity inhibition with CDP-choline and riluzole is well-tolerated in MND. As a consequence a CDP-choline efficacy pilot trial has started.

Xiaoyan Li, Dwight D Koeberl, Michael W Lutz, Richard Bedlack Clenbuterol Treatment Is Safe and Associated With Slowed Disease Progression in a Small Open-Label Trial in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: The 25 participants had a mean age of 59, mean disease duration of 43 months, ALSFRS-R score at enrollment 34, and FVC at enrollment 77%. Forty-eight percent were female, 68% were taking riluzole, and none were taking edaravone. Two participants experienced severe adverse events, neither related to the study. Twenty-four participants experienced adverse events, most commonly tremors/jitters, cramps/spasms, insomnia, and stiffness/spasticity. Fourteen participants withdrew early from the trial, 13 due to adverse events. Patients who withdrew early were significantly older and more likely to be male. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses showed meaningfully slower ALSFRS-R and FVC progression during treatment. Hand grip dynamometry and myometry changes were highly variable between participants; most declined slowly, but some showed improvements. Conclusions: Clenbuterol was safe but less tolerable at the doses we selected compared with an earlier Italian case series. Consistent with that series, our study suggested benefits on ALS progression. However, the latter result should be interpreted with caution as our study is limited by small sample size, large drop out, lack of randomization, and blinding and placebo controls.

At 1 month the rate of responders was 80% with a mean reduction of 70% in severity and disabling VASs. Thirteen patients (92%) reported some benefit from drooling reduction. In objective measurements there was a reduction over 60% in the number of handkerchiefs used. Onset of effect occured few minutes after the inhalation and the duration of the effect was about 24h. Most patients reported better quality of living. The most frequent side-effects were viscous saliva. There were no changes in blood pressure or cardiac rate. At 3 months, there was still a positive effect in all outcomes. All patients except one manifested thier willingness to continue the treatment. Discussion and Conclusions: Clonidine aerosol seems to be effective and safe to treat sialorrhea in ALS. it is suggested that the salivary reduction induced by clonidine may be mediated by a stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which exerts an inhibitory control of the parasympathetic activity on the salivary glands.

The key secondary endpoints including a combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) and change in slow vital capacity (SVC) were also not met at week 24. The prespecified exploratory analyses of the secondary survival endpoint demonstrated a >90% reduction in risk of death alone or risk of death/permanently assisted ventilation at 24 weeks, when adjusting for baseline imbalances in risk (p=0.028 to p=0.075, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) with the CNM-Au8 30 mg dose. These survival results were statistically consistent for the 30 mg dose between the regimen only and full analysis sets, which included shared placebo from other regimens participating in the HEALEY ALS Platform trial (Regimens A, B, and D). The number of events were small in all groups. A survival benefit was not observed among participants randomized to 60 mg CNM-Au8.

The RPSFTM analysis method estimates the survival gained by receiving active treatment using the data from all study participants and then subtracts the benefit from ex-placebo participants switched to CNM-Au8 during the OLE to provide a comparison of CNM-Au8 versus placebo across the entire study period. This well-recognized method has been used to estimate cross-over treatment effects in a recent ALS trial, and oncology and other rare disease trials. Unadjusted median survival (without adjusting for the benefit received in ex-placebo participants; analyses include all study participants): 10.1 month median survival benefit when not accounting for the improvement by ex-placebo treated participants who switched to CNM-Au8 at the start of the OLE (CNM-Au8 median survival of 34.2 months; placebo median survival of 24.1 months). 46% decreased risk of all-cause mortality in participants originally randomized to treatment with CNM-Au8 compared to those originally randomized to placebo (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.25-1.1, log-rank p=0.09).

The rates of change for ALSFRS-R were compared post hoc with a random slopes model. -Statistically significant difference in ALSFRS-R slope from day 1 (randomization) to week 48: among participants originally randomized to active compared to participants originally randomized to placebo (p=0.0159; 2.6-point difference in ALSFRS-R at week 48). This represents an extension of the original double-blind period in which placebo-to-CNM-Au8 OLE participants had not yet reached effective drug concentrations. -Statistically significant difference in ALSFRS-R slope from week 60 to week 120 comparing participants originally randomized to active or placebo. Analyses were conducted starting at 24-weeks in open-label to ensure that ex-placebo participants who switched to CNM-Au8 in the OLE were at steady-state CNM-Au8 concentrations (p=0.0057; 6.0-point difference in ALSFRS-R at week 120). -Statistically significant delay in time to ALS clinical worsening including death, tracheostomy, initiation of ventilatory support, or feeding tube insertion through 120 weeks (Cox hazard ratio 0.478, 95% CI: 0.225 to 1.015, log-rank p=0.0494).

Kiernan Evidence for a survival benefit in ALS with CNM-Au8 treatment: interim results from the RESCUE-ALS trial long-term open label extension Results: Long-term observed survival was compared by treatment group (originally randomized active versus placebo) from randomization through the latest OLE observation with a data-cut of 5-July-2022. This analysis compared early treatment (original active randomization) versus either no-treatment or a 9-month delayed treatment start for ex-placebo participants who transitioned into the OLE. Current vital status was obtained for 43 of the 45 study participants. Data were right censored at the last study contact for participants lost to follow-up (active, n ¼ 1; placebo, n ¼ 1), or as of the data cutoff. There were 5 deaths in the originally randomized active group and 14 deaths in the originally randomized placebo group. Median survival from randomization for the originally randomized active group was undefined due to insufficient mortality events, and median survival for the originally randomized placebo group was 99.7 weeks (23.1 months). Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated a significant mortality benefit with participants initially randomized to CNM-Au8 treatment versus those initially randomized to placebo, resulting in a 70% decreased risk of death, log-rank hazard ratio ¼0.301 (95% CI: 0.122–0.742, p ¼ 0.0143). Sensitivity analyses substituting death in place of lost to follow-up censoring resulted in concordant findings (Hazard Ratio: 0.338, 95% CI: 0.143–0.797, p ¼ 0.0182). Discussion: CNM-Au8 treatment was well-tolerated and there were no significant safety findings reported during the OLE. These results demonstrate improved survival with early CNMAu8 treatment.

The poster titled, “Evidence for a Potential Survival Benefit in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with CNM-Au8 Treatment: Interim Results from the RESCUE-ALS trial Long-Term Open Label Extension,” provides ongoing evidence supporting the clinical benefits of Clene’s lead drug candidate, CNM-Au8®, a catalytically active gold nanocrystal suspension that holds promise as a disease-modifying therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Specifically, the poster evaluated the survival benefit associated with long-term CNM-Au8 treatment. Updated interim analyses of all-cause mortality with up to 137 weeks of follow-up from randomization comparing participants originally randomized to CNM-Au8 to participants originally randomized to placebo demonstrated a significant survival benefit with CNM-Au8 treatment, resulting in approximately a 70% decreased risk of death (HR = 0.29, p=0.01). Sensitivity analyses of observed survival compared to predicted median survival derived from the published ENCALS prediction model based on each participant’s baseline study characteristics, with a data cutoff of August 31, 2022, also demonstrated a significant survival benefit with CNM-Au8 treatment (HR = 0.36, p=0.003). CNM-Au8 treatment was well-tolerated, and there were no significant safety findings reported during the OLE. “These clinical and survival data from RESCUE-ALS contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the potential for CNM-Au8 as a disease-modifying therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),” said Robert Glanzman, MD, FAAN, Clene’s Chief Medical Officer. Rob Etherington, Clene’s CEO, added, “The impressive ALS survival benefits seen with CNM-Au8 treatment corroborate our thesis – energetic support of neurons may protect CNS health and slow neurodegenerative disease progression... ...About Rescue-ALS ...The primary endpoint was not significant, driven by limited MUNIX decline in bulbar-onset participants. However, in a prespecified analyses of limb-onset participants who demonstrated the expected decline in MUNIX scores, there was a strong trend for reducing MUNIX scores (p=0.074). There was a significant reduction in ALS disease progression evident in CNM-Au8 treated participants at week 36 (p=0.0125), and the risk of experiencing significant (≥ 6-point) decline in ALSFRSR was significantly reduced in the CNM-Au8 treated patients (p=0.035). Furthermore, CNMAu8 treated participants demonstrated improved quality of life on the ALSSQOL-SF (p=0.018). Importantly, there were no significant CNM-Au8 related adverse effects reported... https://invest.clene.com/PressReleases/news-details/2022/Clene-Nanomedicine-Presents-Updated-Long-Term-Survival-Data-from-RESCUE-ALS-Participants-at-2022-AANEM-Scientific-Conference/default.aspx; April 1, 2022 [Press release] Updated Interim Data from Clene Nanomedicine’s RESCUE-ALS Open-Label Extension Study to be Presented in Emerging Science Program at 2022 AAN Annual Meeting - Results show significant survival benefit in participants who entered open-label extension of study of CNM-Au8®, a gold nanocrystal suspension, compared to validated ENCALS prediction mode SALT LAKE CITY, April 01, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clene Inc. (NASDAQ: CLNN) along with its subsidiaries “Clene” and its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on revolutionizing the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, today announced new data from the open-label extension of RESCUE-ALS that will be presented in a session at the 2022 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, which will take place April 2-7 in Seattle. Featured in the Emerging Science Program on April 5, the data demonstrate a 70% survival benefit among ALS patients who entered the open-label extension of RESCUE-ALS (n=36, 90% of those eligible). This updated interim analysis of observed survival compared to estimated median survival derived from the validated ENCALS prediction model significantly favored CNM-Au8 treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.3 (corresponding to a 70% lower risk of mortality) for participants who entered the open-label extension (HR 0.3; p=0.006, log-rank test). RESCUE-ALS was a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial that examined the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in 45 participants with early ALS over a 36-week treatment period. The 36-week blinded period of RESCUE-ALS demonstrated significant benefits with CNM-Au8 treatment: slowing ALS disease progression (p=0.0125), decreasing the proportion of participants with a 6-point decline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) (p=0.035), and improving quality of life as measured by the ALS Specific Quality of Life (ALSSQOL-SF) questionnaire (p=0.018).

This month, Clene presented updated clinical data from its Phase II RESCUE-ALS study that indicate the addition of its nanocrystal asset boosts chances of survival. Interim data show an approximately 70% decreased risk of death for participants who entered the RESCUE-ALS long-term open-label extension. The strength of the updated data from the RESCUE-ALS study could be a good predictor of what Clene hopes to see later this summer from the Phase III HEALEY study, which is assessing multiple treatments at one time including CNM-Au8... ... Data from RESCUE-ALS showed that treatment with CNM-Au8 significantly slowed progression of ALS and improved quality of life as it is measured by the ALS Specific Quality of Life questionnaire. It also prevented clinical worsening of the disease, which included the need for a tracheotomy, or full-time use of a CPAP machine to assist breathing or gastrostomy tube to eat. Also, CNM-Au8 treatment resulted in improved brain NAD+/NADH ratio in patients. The data suggest CNM-Au8’s ability to engage its target and support its potential as a disease-modifying therapy, Clene Chief Medical Officer Robert Glanzman, M.D., said in a statement at the time the data was announced. In the fall of 2021, Clene’s initial data from RESCUE-ALS was slightly tarnished after the company announced that CNM-Au8 failed to meet its primary Motor Unit Number Index biomarker endpoint, or its secondary forced vital capacity endpoint. As Clene examined the data, Etherington said the company learned that the benefits of the CNM-Au8 were primarily seen in those patients with limb onset ALS as opposed to bulbar ALS. When assessing the patients who participated in the study, Etherington said the Clene team discovered there were more bulbar patients than those with limb onset. Bulbar patients did not see much improvement from CNM-Au8, while limb onset patients saw 45% improvement, Etheridge said... https://www.biospace.com//article/clene-could-be-big-part-of-momentous-year-for-als-research/; December 10, 2021 [Press release] Clene Nanomedicine to Present RESCUE-ALS Phase 2 Data in Late-Breaking Session at 32nd International Symposium on ALS/MND - Late-breaker oral presentation by Professor Steve Vucic, University of Sydney Medical School and Northcott Chair of Neurology - CNM-Au8®demonstrated significantly slowed disease progression, decreased risk of 6-point ALSFRS-R decline, and improved quality of life in early ALS patients in the RESCUE-ALS trial - CNM-Au8 was well tolerated and safe with no drug-related serious adverse events or drug discontinuations SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clene Inc. (NASDAQ: CLNN) along with its subsidiaries “Clene” and its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on revolutionizing the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, presented data from the RESCUE-ALS Phase 2 study of CNM-Au8®, a catalytically active gold nanocrystal suspension, for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 32nd International Symposium on ALS/MND, Dec. 10, 2021 at 1:05 pm ET. The presentation can be viewed after the presentation on Clene’s website at: https://invest.clene.com/overview/default.aspx. At the late-breaking session, Professor Steve Vucic will present RESCUE-ALS study results that were supportive of CNM-Au8 efficacy for clinically meaningful functional endpoints in an early ALS population. Professor Vucic is Northcott Chair of Neurology, Director Brain and Nerve Research Center, Concord Clinical School, University of Sydney Department of Neurology, Concord Hospital, and one of the study’s expert advisors. RESCUE-ALS, a 36-week randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 45 patients with early ALS, demonstrated: - Significant reduction in risk of disease progression in CNM-Au8 treated patients as defined by the occurrence of death, tracheostomy, or King’s Clinical Stage IV (non-invasive ventilation or gastrostomy). - Significant reduction in risk of major functional decline in CNM-Au8 treated patients as measured by the proportion with = 6-point reduction in ALSFRS-R from Baseline to Week 36. - Significant improvement in quality of life as measured by ALS specific quality of life short form. - Trend for a slower rate of decline in the summated motor unit index (MUNIX) score observed in in limb-onset ALS patients suggesting preservation of lower motor neurons. The primary endpoint, percent change in MUNIX score from Baseline to week 36, was not met. - Trend in preservation of respiratory function, which was more prominent in limb-onset patients. - CNM-Au8 was well tolerated and safe with no drug related serious adverse events or drug discontinuations... ...Additionally, there was a trend in preservation of lower motor neuron and respiratory function, which was more prominent in limb-onset ALS patients. We recognize the potential for CNM-Au8 as a breakthrough treatment for ALS and look forward to upcoming results from larger clinical studies... ...About RESCUE-ALS RESCUE-ALS, a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients with early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the trial, 45 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment with CNM-Au8 (30 mg) or placebo in addition to their current standard of care over a 36-week treatment period. The objective of the trial was to assess the impact of CNM-Au8 on disease progression in patients with early-stage ALS through changes in motor unit index (MUNIX). MUNIX values were evaluated for four muscles in the hand, arm, and leg: the abductor digit minimi, abductor pollicis brevis, tibialis anterior, and biceps brachii from baseline through 36 weeks of treatment. CNM-Au8 was selected by FightMND of Australia, and Clene was provided a substantial grant to investigate efficacy in ALS utilizing novel neurophysiological endpoints including MUNIX at two clinical sites in Australia. For more information, please see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04098406. RESCUE-ALS did not meet the primary endpoint, change in MUNIX score from Baseline to week 36. The study population that presented with bulbar-onset ALS (approximately 27%) of did not worsen in MUNIX as expected (< 10% placebo loss at Week 36). In the population with limb-onset ALS, who did worsen as expected (>40% placebo mean loss at Week 36), treatment with CNM-Au8 resulted in a 45% relative reduction in MUNIX score decline (p=0.0741), suggesting protection of lower motor neurons. Limb onset ALS accounts for approximately 70% of the overall ALS population. CNM-Au8 showed improvement for both limb and bulbar patients across important key clinical endpoints unrelated to MUNIX including the slowing the rate of ALS disease progression (p=0.0125), and the proportion of subjects with <6 point ALSFRS-R decline (p=0.035). https://invest.clene.com/events-and-presentations/Press-Releases/news-details/2021/Clene-Nanomedicine-to-Present-RESCUE-ALS-Phase-2-Data-in-Late-Breaking-Session-at-32nd-International-Symposium-on-ALSMND/default.aspx; December 1, 2021 [Press release] Clene Nanomedicine Presents Updated Data from RESCUE-ALS Phase 2 Study at 4th Annual ALS ONE Research Symposium -CNM-Au8 has favorable impact on progression of ALS as measured by joint rank comparison of combined survival and ALSFRS-R change – a clinically meaningful endpoint recommended by the FDA -CNM-Au8 showed consistent efficacy across limb and bulbar onset participants for ALS disease progression and the proportion with less than a 6-point decline on the ALSFRS-R scale SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clene Inc. (NASDAQ: CLNN) along with its subsidiaries “Clene” and its wholly owned subsidiary Clene Nanomedicine, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on revolutionizing the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, presented new data from the RESCUE-ALS Phase 2 study of CNM-Au8®, a catalytically active gold nanocrystal suspension, in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the 4th Annual ALS ONE Research Symposium which took place virtually on November 30, 2021. New data presented included analyses of CNM-Au8’s efficacy in limb and bulbar onset participants across key endpoints of slowing ALS clinical worsening: - Consistent clinical benefit was shown in both limb and bulbar onset participants for the pre-specified endpoint of ALS disease progression defined as death, or the need for tracheostomy, non-invasive ventilation, or gastrostomy. - Similarly, CNM-Au8 treated participants showed consistent clinical benefit in the proportion without a 6-point decline on the ALSFRS-R across both limb and bulbar onset participants in a post hoc analysis. In a pre-specified joint-rank analysis of survival and ALSFRS-R decline, the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS), CNM-Au8 showed directional benefit. The CAFS combines the change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score with participant survival time. The rating for each participant in the study group is compared to every other participant and a higher CAFS score indicates a better outcome for the group. Despite the small sample size of 45 subjects at 36 weeks, participants treated with CNM-Au8 had an improved average CAFS summated score of +4.4 compared to -4.6 decline for the placebo group (LS Mean Difference; 9.1, 95% CI: -5.8, 23.9; p=0.22).

Results: Stage 1 selected the 2,700mg dose. In Stage 2, the pre-specified primary null hypothesis that this dose is superior to placebo was not rejected. It was rejected, however, in an accompanying prespecified sensitivity test, and further supplementary analyses. Prespecified secondary analyses showed no significant differences between CoQ10 at 2,700mg/day and placebo. There were no safety concerns. Iinterpretation: CoQ10 at 2,700mg daily for 9 months shows insufficient promise to warrant Phase III testing. Given this outcome, the adaptive Phase II design incorporating a dose selection and a futility test avoided the need for a much larger conventional Phase III trial. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19743457?dopt=Abstract http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122380379/abstract; November 3, 2008 Presented at the 19th International Symposium on ALS/MND, November 3-5 2008, Birmingham, UK Kaufmann P, Thompson JLP, Levy G, Barsdorf AI, Buchsbaum R, Montes J, Arbing R, Vecchio D, Tierney A, Bednarz K, Gordon PH, Mitsumoto H, Levin B Abstract no.: C76 Results of a Randomised, Controlled Phase II Trial of CoEnzyme Q10 (COQ10) For ALS Results: A preferred dose (2700mg) was selected in December 2006 at the end of stage 1, using data from 70 patients (35 at each dose).

Taylor1, Susan VanMeter2, Enxu Zhao, Mike Keymer1, David L. Ennist Estimate of an Acthar Gel Treatment Effect in ALS Patients using Virtual Controls. Results: No differences over predicted mortality were apparent in either the full analysis set (FAS) (n=43) or any of the treatment regimens (n=10 or 11). Likewise, no group showed significant improvement in VC. The RCI 16U group showed a trend towards a slight VC improvement, with a possible treatment effect of 1.63% at 8 weeks and 2.28% at 36 weeks and a time to 50% VC KaplanMeier curve better than predicted. No patient in the Acthar 16U group reached the 50% VC threshold. In contrast, both the FAS and the RCI 16U groups achieved statistical significance for the ALSFRS-R outcome. For the FAS, the possible treatment effect was 1.08pts (week 8) and 3.22pts (week 36). The main driver was the RCI 16U group, which had possible treatment effects of 1.57pts and 4.33pts at 8 and 36 weeks. These results should be interpreted cautiously as the predictions have a tendency for type 1 errors. Conclusions: RCI 16U daily administration showed a trend toward slowing the decline of VC (2.28%) and a significant slowing of the decline in ALSFRS-R (4.33 points) at 36 weeks. These studies demonstrate the value of using machine learning predictions as virtual controls in early dose-ranging clinical trials.

Patients in the study received investigational treatment for 48 consecutive weeks and were evaluated for safety and tolerability, Treg function, serum biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and clinical functioning as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale. During the 48-week treatment period, the therapy was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was mild injection-site reactions. No patient discontinued the study, and no deaths or other serious adverse events were reported. Patients' disease progression was measured using the ALSFRS-R scale, a validated rating tool for monitoring the progression of disability in patients with ALS. The mean (±SD) ALSFRS-R scores at week 24 (33.75 ±3.3) and week 48 (32 ±7.8) after initiation of treatment were not statistically different compared to the ALSFRS-R score at baseline (33.5 ±5.9), suggesting significant amelioration in the progression of the disease over the 48-week treatment period. Treg suppressive function, expressed as percentage of inhibition of proinflammatory T cell proliferation, showed a statistically significant increase over the course of the treatment period and was significantly reduced at the end of the 8-week washout post-treatment period. Treg suppressive function at 24 weeks (79.9 ±9.6) and 48 weeks (89.5 ±4.1) were significantly higher compared to baseline (62.1 ±8.1) (p<0.01), suggesting enhanced and durable Treg suppressive function over the course of treatment. In contrast, Treg suppressive function (mean ±SD) was significantly decreased at the end of the 8-week washout period compared to end-of-treatment at week 48 (70.3 ±8.1 vs. 89.5 ±4.1, p <0.05). The study also evaluated serum biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxides. The available data up to 16 weeks after initiation of treatment suggest a decrease in these biomarker levels, which is consistent with the observed enhancement of Treg function. The evaluation of the full biomarker data is ongoing... https://ir.coyatherapeutics.com/news/news-details/2024/Coya-Therapeutics-Presents-Updated-ALS-Biomarker-Data-at-the-2nd-Annual-Johnson-Center-Symposium/default.aspx; March 21, 2023 [Press release] Coya Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Positive Results from a Proof-of-Concept Academic Clinical Study for COYA 302 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 03/21/2023 - The proof-of-concept open-label study evaluated the safety and tolerability, function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), biomarkers, and preliminary efficacy (as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale) of COYA 302 over 48 weeks and was conducted in four ALS patients at the Houston Methodist Hospital by Dr. Stanley Appel and Dr. Jason Thonhoff. - Study data showed no decline or minimal decline at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, after initiation of treatment in a group of patients experiencing a mean decline of -1.1 points/month in their ALSFRS-R score prior to initiation of treatment with COYA 302. The mean (+ or - SD) ALSFRS-R scores at week 24 (33.75 + or - 3.3) and week 48 (32 + or - 7.8) after initiation of treatment were not statistically different compared to the ALSFRS-R score at baseline (33.5 + or - 5.9), indicating significant amelioration in the progression of the disease. - COYA 302 is an investigational combination biologic for subcutaneous administration, comprised of COYA 301 (low dose IL-2) and CTLA4-Ig fusion protein. COYA 302 has a dual mechanism of action and is intended to enhance Treg function in vivo, and downregulate the function of T effector cells, proinflammatory cells, and lipid peroxides. - Over the course of treatment, COYA 302 significantly enhanced Treg suppressive function at 24 weeks and 48 weeks and lowered serum biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. - COYA 302 appeared to be well tolerated in all study patients. HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: COYA) (“Coya” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multiple therapeutic platforms intended to enhance Treg function, including biologics and cell therapies, today reported 48-week clinical data for its proof-of-concept open-label study in 4 ALS patients indicating that treatment with COYA 302 appeared to ameliorate disease progression. Four ALS patients with a mean decline of -1.1 points/month in the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score prior to study initiation, were treated for 48 consecutive weeks with COYA 302 and were evaluated for safety and tolerability, Treg suppressive function, serum biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and clinical functioning as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale. Following the administration of COYA 302 for 48 weeks, patients were evaluated over an 8-week washout period. During the 48-week treatment period, COYA 302 appeared to be well tolerated. The most common adverse event was mild injection-site reactions. No patient discontinued the study, and no deaths or other serious adverse events were reported. Preliminary efficacy of COYA 302 was measured by the ALSFRS-R scale, a validated rating tool for monitoring the progression of disability in patients with ALS. The mean (+ or - SD) ALSFRS-R scores at week 24 (33.75 + or - 3.3) and week 48 (32 + or - 7.8) after initiation of treatment with COYA 302 were not statistically different compared to the ALSFRS-R score at baseline (33.5 ±5.9), indicating significant amelioration in the progression of the disease over the 48-week treatment period. Treg suppressive function, expressed as percentage of inhibition of proinflammatory T cell proliferation, showed a statistically significant increase over the course of the treatment period and was significantly reduced at the end of the 8-week washout post-treatment period. Treg suppressive function at 24 weeks (79.9+ or - 9.6) and 48 weeks (89.5 + or - 4.1) were significantly higher compared to baseline (62.1 + or - 8.1) (p<0.01), suggesting enhanced and durable Treg suppressive function over the course of treatment. In contrast, Treg suppressive function (mean + or -SD) was significantly decreased at the end of the 8-week washout period compared to end-of-treatment at week 48 (70.3 + or -8.1 vs. 89.5 + or - 4.1, p <0.05). The study also evaluated serum biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxides. The available data up to 16 weeks after initiation of treatment suggest a decrease of these biomarker levels, which is consistent with the observed enhancement of Treg function. The evaluation of the full biomarker data is ongoing. Stanley Appel M.D., Professor at Houston Methodist and Chair of Coya’s Scientific Advisory Board commented, “Our study with a combination of IL-2 and CTLA4-Ig provided promising results. The therapy was well tolerated, and most significantly it enhanced regulatory T lymphocytes suppressive functions, suppressed markers of oxidative stress, and ameliorated disease progression over 48 weeks. The average patient decline, as measured by ALSFRS-R, is approximately -1-point/month. In the present study there was no average decline from baseline to 24 weeks and we observed minimal average decline from baseline to 48 weeks, suggesting that IL-2 and CTLA4-Ig may provide a potentially meaningful approach for the 'unmet need' in ALS.” https://ir.coyatherapeutics.com/news/news-details/2023/Coya-Therapeutics-Inc.-Announces-Positive-Results-from-a-Proof-of-Concept-Academic-Clinical-Study-for-COYA-302-in-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS/default.aspx",,TrialTroveID-463414,,,,463414,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,"March 21, 2023 ...During the 48-week treatment period, COYA 302 appeared to be well tolerated.

Results: No significant differences in the occurrence at any time of adverse effects due to creatine supplementation were found (23 % nausea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group, 19 % gastro-intestinal discomfort in the creatine group, vs. 18 % in the placebo group, 35 % diarrhoea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group). After two months of treatment, oedematous limbs were seen more often in subjects using creatine, probably due to water retention. Severe diarrhoea (n = 2) and severe nausea (n = 1) caused 3 subjects in the creatine group to stop intake of creatine, after which these adverse effects subsided. Conclusion: Long-term supplementation of creatine did not lead to an increase of plasma urea levels (5.69 + or - 1.47 before treatment vs. 5.26 + or - 1.44 at the end of treatment) or to a higher prevalence of micro-albuminuria (5.4 % before treatment vs. 1.8 % at the end of treatment). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15795816 http://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/abstract/sportsmed/doi/10.1055/s-2004-817917; March 24, 2003 Ann Neurol. 2003 Apr;53(4):437-45.

Creatine did not affect survival (cumulative survival probability of 0.70 in the creatine group vs 0.68 in the placebo group at 12 months, and 0.52 in the creatine group vs 0.47 in the placebo group at 16 months), or the rate of decline of functional measurements. Creatine intake did not cause important adverse reactions. Conclusions: This placebo-controlled trial did not find evidence of a beneficial effect of creatine monohydrate on survival or disease progression in patients with ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12666111 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.10554/abstract","Secondary outcomes Rate of decline of isometric arm muscle strength, forced vital capacity, functional status, and quality of life.",TrialTroveID-079570,"Primary endpoints Death, persistent assisted ventilation, or tracheostomy",,Change in FVC Quality of Life,79570,,Efficacy > Respiratory Function Heor > Health-Related Quality Of Life,,Ii,,3,0,4,0,3,0,10,FUNCTIONAL,0,0,0,0

ALSFRS-R decrease was 0.5 points/month for all 19 subjects. Non-bulbar cases in Phase 1 and 2a had comparable mean change in ALSFRS-R over 24 weeks (-0.4 versus -0.3 points/month). ECAS A-B-C score increased by +7.8 points (p = 0.02) which is comparable to the ECAS increase in the Phase 1 cohort (+10.25). Conclusions: Marked CuATSM treatment effects on disease severity and cognitive function relative to historical controls were observed in sALS in both phase 1 and phase 2a cohorts. These results stimulated the ongoing multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to definitively establish the efficacy of CuATSM. https://index.mirasmart.com/AAN2020/PDFfiles/AAN2020-001338.html; November 20, 2018 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 19, Issue S1, November 2018 Presented at the 29th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2018, Glasgow, Scotland Online published date: November 20, 2018 Abstract No.: CLT-26 Dominic Rowe, Susan Mathers, Georgia Smith, Emma Windebank, MaryLouise Rogers, Kay Noel, Craig S. Rosenfeld Modification of ALS Disease Progression in a Phase 1 Trial of CuATSM Interim Results: Five cohorts were accrued at doses of 3, 12, 36, 72 and 144 mg/day. At abstract submission, six month assessments had been completed for the 72 mg cohort. At 72 mg, Cmax approached levels comparable to survival benefit in SOD1G93A mice. Over six months, the 72 mg cohort showed mean decrease in ALSFRS-R of - 1.67 points (0.17 points/month), mean increase in FVC of +4% predicted, and mean increase in ECAS of +12 points. Including data from all dose levels, the total ECAS score increased by +8.5 points over six months, driven by +6.5 point increase in ALS-specific score. Data for the 144 mg cohort and biomarker evaluations should be available at the International Symposium on ALS/MND meeting. Conclusions: At the 72 mg dose level, CuATSM appears to have disease-modifying effects in ALS. These compelling results justify assessment in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to confirm tolerance and treatment benefit at the RP2D.

Interim Results: Through 25 May 2017, 12 patients received CuATSM at dose levels of 3 and 12 mg/day. Cohorts included patients with both familial and sporadic disease. PK parameters were dose-proportional. Treatment was well tolerated; no dose-limiting drug related toxicities have been observed. To date, no patient has developed disease progression on therapy; all patients remain on CuATSM treatment. The current dose cohort is being treated at 36 mg/day. Discussion and conclusions: Based on observed safety, PK and efficacy parameters of treated patients, dose escalation is continuing. At the meeting, the study will be updated with completed accrual of the dose-escalation phase.

AOPPs increased in PG at T1>T0 (p<0.05), but not in CG. In CG, than in PG, FRAP increased at T1 and at T2 (p<0.01), as well as t-SH levels were increased at T1>T0 (p<0.05), with a positive trend after six months of curcumin administration (T2>T0, p=0.05). In CG compared to PG higher FRAP and t-SH levels were observed at T1 and T2 (0.01<p<0.001), while AOPP levels not changed between groups. Conclusion: Treatment with curcumin shows encouraging results as modulator of the non-enzymatic antioxidants although it not influence the clinical course of the disease. Although further studies are needed to confirm these data, these observations can be useful to deepen knowledge into the pathogenic mechanisms of ALS.

The intra-group analysis showed that AOPP levels in PG significantly increased at T1>T0 (p=0.01), while in CG they remained unchanged over time ((T2-T1-T0, p=ns). In CG, with respect to PG, FRAP increased after curcumin administration both at T1>T0 (p=0.001) and at T2>T1 (p=0.01), as did t-SH at T1>T0 (p=0.02), with a positive trend also after 6 months of curcumin administration (T2-T0, p=0.06). The inter-group analysis revealed in CG compared to PG lower AOPP levels, at T1 (p=0.02) and T2 (not significant, p=0.07), as well as significant higher FRAP and t-SH levels at T1 and T2 (0.01< or =p< or =0.001). Treatment with curcumin in ALS confirms encouraging results as modulator of th intracellualr redox homeostasis, decreasing the oxidative damage, as observed by the rise of FRAP and t-SH levels. Conclusion: Although the clinical course of the disease did not change over the 6 months considered duration of the study, results suggest that further studies are worthy to be done in order to confirm these data, at the same time contributing to deepen knowledge into pathogenic mechanisms of ALS.

However, intragroup analysis showed encouraging results, which indicate a lower progression of disease in patients taking oral supplementation. In particular in the drug group: ALSFRS-r and MRC scores showed no significant decline when comparing T1–T0 (ALSFRS-r p = 0.101, MRC p = 0.056; T2–T1 ALSFRS-r p = 0.524, MRC p = 0.074) but also, only for ALSFRS-r score, T2–T0 (p = 0.290). In the placebo-group after a significant decline in the placebo phase, a score stabilization was observed comparing T2– T1 (ALSFRS-r p = 0.076, MRC p = 0.191). A significant decline in BMI was observed in the placebo group when comparing T2-T0 (p = 0.039), but not in the drug group (p = 0.263). As regards the laboratory parameters, curcumin oral supplementation acted positively on the production of lactic acid profile during a muscular effort, suggesting a supporting role of mitochondrial metabolism. In particular, the difference of the lactic acid between the two groups at time T1, nothing at rest, increases progressively during exercise, reaching a statistical significance at the maximum effort (p = 0.018). FRAP, AOPP, and plasma thiols analysis demonstrated uncertain results suggesting the involvement of alternative molecular pathways. Discussion and conclusions: Further studies will be needed to confirm the possible therapeutic role of curcumin on ALS and to deepen knowledge of the molecular basis of motor neuron degeneration.

Limitations and Caveats: [Not Specified] [Refer to source URL for tabular data] https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04499963?tab=results","Secondary Outcome Measures : Number of Participants With ALS Reversal [ Time Frame: Month 6 ] Number of participants who have an ALSFRS-R (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) score that improves by 4 points or more over 6 months. The ALSFRS-R is used to determine patients' assessments of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Change in ALSFRS-R scores correlate with change in strength over time, and it is closely associated with quality of life measures and predicted survival. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 48=best. Total Number of Adverse Events as Measured by Patient Reporting [ Time Frame: up to 6 months ] Adverse and serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the study. Enrollment Rate [ Time Frame: up to 6 months ] The number of participants enrolled divided by the number of months it took to enroll them. Retention as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Completed the 6 Month Study Visit [ Time Frame: month 6 ] The percentage of enrolled participants who completed the 6 month study visit. Shannon Diversity Index of the Oral Microbiome [ Time Frame: Baseline, month 1, month 6 ] Comparing the changes in the saliva microbiome over time in patients with ALS on Theracurmin to the changes observed in untreated healthy controls. Data will be compared within subjects with ALS to assess possible changes over the length of the study and identify microbial correlates of disease progression. The Shannon diversity index takes into account the number of species living in a habitat (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness). The minimum value is 0, which indicates no diversity (only one species is found). There is no upper limit to the index; the maximum value occurs when all species have the same number of individuals. Baseline was compared to post-treatment samples from months 1 and 6 analyzed together. Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity of the Oral Microbiome [ Time Frame: Baseline, month 1, and month 6 ] Comparing the changes in the saliva microbiome over time in patients with ALS on Theracurmin to the changes observed in untreated healthy controls. Data will be compared within subjects with ALS to assess possible changes over the length of the study and identify microbial correlates of disease progression. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a measure of biodiversity, based on phylogeny (the tree of life). PD is defined as equal to the sum of the lengths of all the branches on the tree that span the members of the set. The branch lengths on the tree count the relative number of new features arising along that part of the tree. Baseline was compared to post-treatment samples from months 1 and 6 analyzed together.

ALSFRS-R,0,"September 15, 2022 [Press Release] BioJiva Reports Results of Pilot Phase 2 Clinical Trial of RT001 in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - Signals of Clinical Benefit Detected in Small Phase 2 Study, Suggesting Potential to Show Statistically Significant Therapeutic Benefit in Larger, Targeted Trial - Consistent Benefit vs. Placebo in Primary and Secondary Endpoints, With Greater Benefit Witnessed in More Severe Patients LOS ALTOS, Calif., Sept. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioJiva, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class therapies for degenerative diseases, today reported data from its completed multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating RT001, the company’s lead development candidate, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease). The trial’s prespecified primary endpoint was change from baseline in the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) following 24 weeks of treatment. At 24 weeks, data demonstrated that patients treated with RT001 experienced less worsening (a 3.3-point reduction from baseline) in ALSFRS-R score as compared to greater worsening (4.6-point reduction from baseline) for the placebo group. Similarly, patients treated with RT001 experienced less worsening (a 13.3-point increase from baseline) in their score on the 40-item ALS assessment questionnaire (ALSAQ40) as compared to the placebo group (a 17.2-point increase from baseline). While suggesting a signal of directional improvement with RT001 treatment, these findings did not achieve statistical significance due to the small size of the study. This six-month randomized Phase 2 pilot study (NCT04762589), which was followed by a six-month open-label extension during which all patients received RT001, was conducted at four ALS Centers of Excellence in Europe. Investigators enrolled 43 patients with ALS who had symptom duration of less than three years. Enrolled patients had baseline ALSFRS-R scores ranging from 25 to 44, with a mean of 38.2 (+/-5.0.). Thirty-nine of the 43 enrolled subjects completed the initial 24-week randomized phase, with 32 of those also completing the open-label extension for a full year of treatment. At Week 24, patients receiving RT001 demonstrated a worsening from baseline in ALSFRS-R score of 3.3 points (from 38.2 to 34.9), as compared to a 4.6-point worsening from baseline for the placebo group (from 38.2 to 33.6). For patients who were enrolled with more severe disease (ALSFRS-R <41 and ALSAQ40 < 20; n=33), the difference in disease progression was more pronounced with RT001 treatment (3.4-point reduction for RT001 vs. 6.3-point reduction for placebo). Data from the study’s 24-week open-label extension portion demonstrated that a signal of clinical benefit with RT001 treatment was also evident at 12 months. As no concurrent placebo was administered after 24 weeks, 12-month comparisons were made using data from the PRO ACT Database1, a validated and predictive historical control database of ALS progression. At 12 months, RT001-treated patients demonstrated a decrease in ALSFRS-R score of 7.2 +/- 6.7 points, whereas the PRO ACT Database shows an expected worsening on the ALSFRS score at 12 months of 10.1 points. For the study’s most severe patients that completed 12 months (ALSFRS-R < 41 and ALSAQ40 < 20; n=14), the 12-month reduction in ALSFRS-R score was 5.6 +/- 9.2 points with RT001 treatment, showing an even greater slowing in disease progression... ...said Leonard H. van den Berg, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, director of the Netherlands ALS Center, Chairman of TRICALS, an ALS clinical trial-focused European research initiative spanning 42 top research centers in 15 countries, and the principal investigator of the study... ...We conducted this trial with the dual goals of better understanding the manner in which RT001 may potentially impact the progression of ALS and detecting a signal of therapeutic benefit for patients receiving the treatment. While a small study that was not powered to demonstrate significance, we did see trends for RT001-treated patients compared to the placebo group that suggest the potential for RT001 to offer patients meaningful clinical benefit. The learnings from this study position us to continue development of RT001 for ALS, advancing next to a larger, statistically powered study focused on the more severe patient population that appears more likely to benefit from the treatment,” said Mark G.

Received 21 July 2020; Revised 25 August 2020; Accepted 26 August 2020 Epub 2020 Aug 29. Plasma and Red Blood Cell Membrane Accretion and Pharmacokinetics of RT001 (bis-Allylic 11,11-D2-Linoleic Acid Ethyl Ester) during Long Term Dosing in Patients Results: We report here on the plasma and red cell (RBC) pharmacokinetics (PK) of D2-LA, and its metabolite 13,13-D2-arachidonic acid (D2-AA), in patients with multiple neurodegenerative diseases (total of 59 participants). In Friedreich's ataxia patients, D2-LA was absorbed and transported similarly to dietary LA, peaking at about 6 h after oral dosing. Plasma D2-LA concentrations approached steady state after 28 days of dosing. After 6 months of daily dosing in subjects with other disorders, D2-LA and D2-AA levels were at or above the 20% of total (D2-LA/total LA, or D2-AA/total AA) therapeutic targets for most subjects. Conclusion: We conclude that chronic dosing of RT001 and associated dietary guidance can be maintained over many months to achieve target plasma and RBC levels, forming a basis for therapeutic dosing across a broad range of conditions. RT001 has been safe and well-tolerated in 59 different participants treated across 10 different neurodegenerative diseases in multiple clinical trials for up to 36 months with no significant drug related adverse events limiting use. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/549af14ae4b004237f7bb71a/t/5f5d2b8bd7536c1e1e063887/1599941516044/2020-09+Brenna+JPharmSci+2020.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871154/",,TrialTroveID-333164,,,,333164,,,,I,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Likewise, in Group 2, PRX coadministration increased the AUC and Cmax of the AVP-786 components d6-DM (2.18 fold and 1.81 fold) and Q (1.33 fold and 1.25 fold) with a corresponding decrease in exposure to the d3-DX metabolite (AUC decrease 28.4%; Cmax decrease 32.9%) compared with AVP- 786 alone. In Group 3, AVP-786 coadministration increased steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) of DUL 1.84 fold and Cmax 1.68 fold vs DUL alone. In Group 4 DUL did not appreciably affect the d6-DM or Q component of AVP-786 nor the d3-DX metabolite. The percentages of subjects reporting any AE on monotherapy vs. combination therapy were: Group 1: 50% vs. 83%, Group 2: 64% vs. 93%, Group 3: 43% vs. 50% and Group 4: 50% vs. 50%. The most commonly reported AEs in Groups 1 and 2 (AVP-786 and PRX) were dizziness, diarrhea, nausea. The most commonly reported AEs in Groups 3 and 4 (AVP-786 and DUL) were fatigue and muscle tightness. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG assessments showed no clear safety differences between treatments. Conclusions: This phase 1 study showed that AVP-786 coadministration increased systemic exposure to PRX (~1.6 fold) and DUL (~1.8 fold) compared with either drug alone. Likewise, PRX increased exposure (~2.2 fold) to the d6-DM, component of AVP-786 with a corresponding decrease (~28%) in d3-DX metabolite exposure; Q exposure was modestly increased (~33%). DUL did not appear to affect exposure to d6-DM, its metabolite or Q.

PPX was not detected in any of the samples tested ( < 0.300 ng/mL in the presence of up to 1860 ng/mL of DEX). Discussion and conclusions: PPX was not detected in humans at pharmacologically signifi cant levels in human plasma after administration of dexpramipexole at doses up to 600 mg/day. Therefore, chiral conversion of DEX to PPX, if it occurs at all, occurs very rarely and does not lead to pharmacologically active PPX in vivo. http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/17482968.2012.721231C",,TrialTroveID-179548,,,,179548,,,,I,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Most subjects in the dexpramipexole and placebo-treated groups reported an AE (97% dex pramipexole and 96% placebo). Similar incidences of AEs were observed for both treatment groups with respect to sever ity; AEs considered moderate or severe (81% dexpramipexole and 80% placebo); AEs considered severe (39% dexpramipexole and 40% placebo); serious adverse events (SAEs) (47% dexpramipexole and 50% placebo); subjects who discontinued study treatment due to an AE (11% dexpramipexole and 8% placebo); subjects withdrawing from the study due to an AE (13% dexpramipexole and 13% placebo). More subjects treated with dexpramipexole 150 mg BID experienced AEs related to study treatment (46%) than those who were treated with placebo (32%). Consistent with previous reports, the inci dence of neutropenia was higher in participants treated with dexpramipexole (8%) compared with those who received placebo (2%). The most common adverse events (at least 5% incidence and 2% more than placebo) were constipation, nausea, and weight decreased; insomnia; muscular weakness; cough; dizziness; dry mouth; neutropenia; upper respiratory tract infection; and neck pain. The incidence of deaths in the treatment groups was similar, 19% of subjects in the dexprami- pexole group and 22% of subjects in the placebo group. Conclusion: Dexpramipexole was well tolerated in EMPOWER with comparable overall incidences of SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and withdrawals due to AEs between the dexpramipexole and placebo groups. No previously unidentifi ed safety issues emerged compared with the earlier phase 2 study of dexpramipexole. No dose-limiting safety signals were observed.

Results: Between March 28, 2011, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 943 participants (474 randomly allocated dexpramipexole, 468 randomly allocated placebo, and one withdrew). Least-square mean CAFS scores at 12 months did not differ between participants in the dexpramipexole group (score 441·76, 95% CI 415·43-468·08) and those in the placebo group (438·84, 412·81-464·88; p=0·86). At 12 months, we noted no differences in mean change from baseline in ALSFRS-R total score (-13·34 in the dexpramipexole group vs -13·42 in the placebo group; p=0·90) or time to death (74 [16%] vs 79 [17%]; hazard ratio 1·03 [0·75-1·43]; p=0·84). 37 (8%) participants in the dexpramipexole group developed neutropenia compared with eight (2%) participants in the placebo group, and incidence of other adverse events was similar between groups. Interpretation: Dexpramipexole was generally well tolerated but did not differ from placebo on any prespecified efficacy endpoint measurement. Our trial can inform the design of future clinical research strategies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24067398 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970221-7/abstract; April 25, 2012 Presented at the 64th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 21-28, 2012, New Orleans, LA Abstract No: S25.004 Merit Cudkowicz, Leonard Van den Berg, Michael Bozik, Evan Ingersoll, Alex Coppell, Wildon R.

The treatment effect of dexpramipexole on ALSFRS-R slope was similar in subjects receiving riluzole (-1.09 for 300 mg, -1.38 for 50 mg) and in subjects not receiving riluzole (-0.89 for 300 mg, -1.19 for 50 mg). There was no evidence of an interaction between dexpramipexole and riluzole on slope of ALSFRS-R (p = 0.98). The 24-week mortality rate was lower in the dexpramipexole 300 mg group than in the 50 mg group, 7.2% vs 19.9%, which corresponds to a reduction in hazard rate of 68%. The effect of dexpramipexole on mortality was independent of concomitant riluzole use. In subjects taking concomitant riluzole, the Kaplan-Meier estimates (SE) were 17.2% (7.9%) in the 50 mg group and 7.1% (4.9%) in the 300 mg group. In subjects not taking concomitant riluzole, the estimates (SE) were 22.7% (8.9%) in the 50 mg group and 7.1% (6.9%) in the 300 mg group. The numbers of subjects in each cell ( + or - dexpramipexole and + or - riluzole) were too small to warrant statistical evaluation of interaction effects. Discussion and conclusions: In this small Phase 2 study, results suggest that concomitant riluzole treatment neither augments nor diminishes the treatment effect of dexpramipexole on survival or functional decline in ALS. It will be useful to confi rm this observation in the defi nitive Phase 3 studies of dexpramipexole in ALS (Page# 117/165) http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=2626; November 20, 2011 Nat Med. 2011 Nov 20;17(12):1652-6. doi: 10.1038/nm.2579.

Conclusion: Trends showing a dose-dependent attenuation of the slope of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) in part 1 and a statistically significant (P = 0.046) difference between groups in a joint rank test of change from baseline in ALSFRS-R and mortality in part 2 strongly support further testing of dexpramipexole in ALS. http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.2579.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22101764; December 12, 2010 Presented at the Joint Meeting of 21st International Symposium on ALS/MND and 18th Annual Meeting International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations, December 7-13, 2010, Orlando, FL Sessions Type: Clinical Sessions Session Title: Session 8C - Clinical trials (53 kb) Abstract ID# C55 Ingersoll E , Archibald D , Schoenfeld D , Moore Dh , Gribkoff V , Mather J , Cudkowicz M , Hefner J , Miller Rg , Bozik M Analysis Of Functional Scores Data In A Study Of Dexpramipexole For Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis In The Context Of Non-Trivial Discontinuations And Deaths Results: Twenty-one subjects discontinued (14 in the 50 mg group and 7 in the 300 mg group), including 12 deaths (9 in 50 mg and 3 in 300 mg, P = 0.071). Three of the 12 deaths were in subjects who had previously discontinued for other reasons (2 in 50 mg and 1 in 300 mg). The unadjusted mean slope in Part 2 of CL201 for subjects who died was steeper than for survivors (-1.80 vs. 1.08, respectively). The same pattern was observed for all discontinuers vs. completers. The LMEM analysis showed a 20% difference in slopes favoring 300 mg (P = 0.178), which increased to 43% with zero imputation (P = 0.018). The joint rank test of mortality and ALSFRS R also favored the 300 mg group (P = 0.046). Discussion and Conclusions: In ALS trials, discontinuations and deaths complicate the interpretation of observed cases. Slope estimates per se do not refl ect the seriousness of death. Zero imputation is useful only to illustrate effects of bias as a sensitivity analysis. A true intent-to-treat analysis of mortality requires post-study follow-up for all subjects who discontinue. The joint-rank test is based on an intuitively reasonable ranking of outcomes with appropriate weighting of death outcomes, which involves minimal statistical assumptions. This study demonstrates that the joint-rank test in ALS is a novel, powerful method that bears further investigation as a primary analysis method in future trials.

In the 300 mg dexpramipexole group, mean changes were -0.6 (fi ne), -0.9 (gross), -0.3 (bulbar), and -0.5 (respiratory). The largest magnitude nominal treatment effect was in the fine motor domain. Discussion and conclusions: The concordance between the placebo cohort in this study and the population studied by Cedarbaum et al provides external validation for the ALSFRS- R as a measure of functional decline in a randomized clinical trial. The greater magnitude of decline observed in CL201 may be a function of differences in inclusion criteria, but the pattern and relative percentages of decline were similar across the sub-domains. The sub-domain with the greatest decline over 12 weeks in the placebo group was fi ne motor, in which domain the largest magnitude treatment effect with 300 mg dexpramipexole was also seen.

Twenty-three subjects participated in the PK sub-study. There were no deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events over 12 weeks. Two subjects (1 placebo; 1 300mg) discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). There were no per-treatment-group differences in the overall incidences of AEs, treatment-related AEs, or pre-specified clinically significant vital sign, ECG, or laboratory abnormalities. Two subjects (300mg) had reversible CTC grade II neutropenia, one of whom restarted treatment with KNS-760704 in Part 2 without recurrence. Mean/median changes from baseline to endpoint in ALSFRSR total scores were -3.6/-4.0 (placebo), -5.0/-3.0 (50mg), -3.3/-2.5 (150mg), and -2.2/-2.0 (300mg). Relative to the decline in the placebo group, the 300mg group showed a 39% improvement in mean ALSFRS-R change from baseline to endpoint and a 50% improvement in median ALSFRS-R change from baseline to endpoint. Mean changes from baseline to study endpoint in upright VC (% predicted) were -13.1 (placebo), -10.8 (50mg), -6.4 (150mg) and -10.7 (300mg). Pharmacokinetics were linear over the range of doses tested and t1/2 was ~8 hours. Discussion: KNS-760704 was safe and well-tolerated in this study. Encouraging dose-related and time-dependent improvements in ALSFRS-R total scores relative to the placebo group observed in this study suggest that KNS-760704 may slow the rate of motor function loss in ALS subjects. Further evaluation of KNS-760704 in larger and longer studies is merited. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1668 Page (1 of 3)",Secondary Outcome Measures Number of subjects experiencing unacceptable safety or tolerability events after oral administration of KNS-760704 compared to placebo for up to 76 weeks in subjects with ALS (Part 2) [ Time Frame: 76 weeks ] Change from Baseline in ALSFRS-R [ Time Frame: 12 weeks (part 1) and 28 weeks (part 2) ] Change from baseline to Week 12 in upright and supine vital capacity [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Changes in cystatin C and neurofilament H [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ],CL201 KNS 760704-CL201 KNS-760704-CL201 NCT00647296 TrialTroveID-078900,Primary Outcome Measures Number of subjects experiencing unacceptable safety or tolerability events after oral administration of KNS-760704 compared to placebo for 12 weeks in subjects with ALS (Part 1) [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ],A total of 102 subjects were enrolled at 20 US centers; 98 subjects (96%) completed the study... http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1668; Participant Flow Period Title: Part 1: 12-week Double-Blind Treatment Placebo Twice Daily Started:27 Completed: 26 Not Completed :1 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Adverse Event : 1 Physician Decision: 0 50 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 23 Completed: 22 Not Completed :1 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Adverse Event : 0 Physician Decision: 1 150 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 26 Completed: 26 Not Completed :0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Adverse Event: 0 Physician Decision: 0 300 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 26 Completed: 24 Not Completed 2 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 1 Adverse Event: 1 Physician Decision: 0 Period Title: Part 2: 4-week Placebo Washout Started: 97 Completed: 92 Not Completed :5 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 1 Lost to Follow-up: 1 Death: 3 50 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 0 Completed: 0 Not Completed :0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 0 150 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 0 Completed: 0 Not Completed :0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 0 300 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 0 Completed: 0 Not Completed :0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 0 Period Title: Part 2: 76-week Double-Blind Treatment Placebo Twice Daily Started: 0 Completed: 0 Not Completed:0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Adverse Event: 0 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 0 Inability to attend study visits in person: 0 50 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 48 Completed: 33 Not Completed:15 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 5 Adverse Event : 1 Lost to Follow-up: 1 Death: 7 Inability to attend study visits in person: 1 150 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 0 Completed: 0 Not Completed:0 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 0 Adverse Event: 0 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 0 Inability to attend study visits in person: 0 300 mg/Day Dexpramipexole Started: 44 Completed: 30 Not Completed :14 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject: 4 Adverse Event: 4 Lost to Follow-up: 0 Death: 5 Inability to attend study visits in person: 1 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00647296,ALSFRS-R Safety and Tolerability,78900,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,"November 20, 2011 Trends showing a dose-dependent attenuation of the slope of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) in part 1 and a statistically significant (P = 0.046) difference between groups in a joint rank test of change from baseline in ALSFRS-R and mortality in part 2 strongly support further testing of dexpramipexole in ALS. http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.2579.html",Ii,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",5,14,1,1,1,0,22,SAFETY,1,0,0,1

One or more adverse events were reported by 50% of the study participants and the intensity of adverse events was generally mild. Adverse events were reported by 67% of subjects in the placebo group, by 33% of subjects in the 50 mg group, and by 50% each of subjects in the 150 mg, 300 mg, and Fed 150 mg groups. The most frequent adverse event was dizziness, reported by 6 of 30 (20%) total study subjects, by 3 of 6 (50%) subjects in the placebo group and by 1 of 6 (17%) subjects in each of the 150 mg, 300 mg, and fed 150 mg groups. The adverse event profile in each active dose group was similar to that in the placebo group and there was no evidence suggesting that any specific treatment-emergent adverse events occurred with greater frequency in subjects receiving KNS- 760704 than in subjects receiving placebo. Therewas no evidence of clinically significant effects of KNS-760704 on heart rate or blood pressure and specifically no evidence of orthostatic hypotension. There were no clinically significant or dose- dependent changes from baseline on physical exams or ECGs. There were no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities judged to be drug related.Pharmacokinetic data indicated that KNS-760704 is rapidly absorbed with mean maximum concentrations (Cmax ) of 125, 360, 781, and 315 ng/mL reached at approximately 2 to 2.5 hours post-dose for the 50, 150, 300 and 150 (fed) mg dose groups, respectively (Figure 1 and Table 1). Mean exposures (AUC0-8 ) were 1254, 3815, 8623, and 3397 h*ng/mL for the 50, 150, 300 and 150 mg (fed) dose groups, respectively. Both Cmax and AUC increased in proportion to dose across the dose levels tested. The mean T½ was independent of dose. Comparison of the mean plasma concentrations and mean pharmacokinetic parameters after administration of a single 150 mg dose following a high fat/high calorie breakfast with those after administration of a 150 mg dose under fasted conditions demonstrates essentially no effect of a meal on the absorption and elimination of KNS- 760704. Urinary recovery of unchanged KNS- 760704 was comparable across the two fasted cohorts for which complete urine collections were available and the food-effect panel, averaging 94.7% for the 50 mg fasted cohort, 88.3% for the 300 mg fasted cohort, and 88.6 % for the 150 mg fed cohort (Figure 2). Excretion appears to be essentially complete by 36 hours after drug administration, consistent with the ~7-hour T½ . Conclusions: Preliminary results of this study demonstrate that single oral doses of 50, 150, and 300 mg KNS- 760704 are safe and well-tolerated. The drug is orally bioavailable and the pharmacokinetics are linear. Absorption and elimination are not affected by a high fat/high calorie meal.

There were no serious adverse events; 46% of all subjects reported a non-serious adverse event (AE). Most AEs were mild; the most frequent AE was mild dizziness. There were no clinically significant safety observations at any dose level. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that KNS-760704 is rapidly absorbed with mean maximum concentrations of 125, 360, and 781 ng/mL reached at approximately 2 hours post-dose for the 50, 150, and 300 mg dose groups, respectively. Mean exposures (AUC0-8) were 1254, 3815, and 8623 h×ng/mL for the 50, 150, and 300 mg dose groups, respectively. Both Cmax and AUC increased in proportion to dose across the dose levels tested. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug accounted for approximately 70% of drug elimination across dose levels. The mean T½ was 6-7 hours and was independent of dose. Conclusions: Results of this study demonstrate that single oral doses of 50, 150, and 300 mg KNS-760704 are safe and well-tolerated. The drug is orally bioavailable and the pharmacokinetics are linear. The 300 mg dose is 2400 times higher than the recommended starting dose of Mirapex®.

The DIGEST total score is determined using the composite of individual airway safety and bolus efficiency subscores (range: 0-4). The DIGEST total is rated on a 5-point ordinal score ranging from 0 (no dysphagia) to 4 (life-threatening dysphagia). Change in Speech Intelligibility [ Time Frame: Baseline; Day 30 ] The Sentence Intelligibility Test (SIT) will be performed to assess the change in speaking intelligibility over the 30 day period. The primary outcome of the SIT will be the percentage of sentence intelligibility (%) during oral reading. Change in Patient-reported Outcome: Center for Neurologic Study-Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS) [ Time Frame: Baseline; Day 30 ] The CNS-BFS is a validated patient-reported scale that assess self-reported impairments in the domains of speech, salivation and swallowing. Each domain contains 7 questions with ratings ranging from 1-5 with 5 considered the worst. For the speech domain, individuals who are unable to speak are assigned a value of 6 for each item (speech domain ranges from 1-6). Total scores ranging from 21 (no impairment) - 112 (severe impairment in all domains). Change in ALSFRS-R Bulbar Subscale Score [ Time Frame: Baseline; Day 30 ] The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised Bulbar subscore is an outcome comprised of questions 1-3 on the validated ALSFRS-R scale. These items rate speech, swallowing and salivation functions on a scale from 0-total loss of function to 4- no symptoms for a total score of 0 to 12. Bamboo Passage Reading Duration (in Seconds) [ Time Frame: Baseline; Day 30 ] The Bamboo Passage is a 60-word reading passage that is commonly used to measure speech duration. The primary endpoint was change in the rater‐administered ALSFRS‐R bulbar subscore. This outcome is comprised of three questions specific to speech, swallowing, and salivation rated on a 5‐point ordinal scale (0 to 4). Total ALSFRS‐R bulbar subscores range from 0 indicating a total loss of bulbar function to 12 indicating no bulbar symptoms. Primary efficacy outcome The ALSFRS‐R bulbar subscore significantly increased from 7.50 (SD: 2.00) to 8.41 (SD: 1.79) pre‐ versus post‐treatment, respectively (mean difference: 0.92, 95% CI, 0.49–1.35, p < 0.001). Seventy‐five percent (n = 18) of participants completing the drug protocol improved (increased) in their total ALSFRS‐R bulbar subscore, 12.5% (n = 3) decreased (worsened), and 12.5% (n = 3) remained unchanged.","ALS Individuals With Bulbar Dysfunction Started 28 Completed 24 Not Completed 4 Reason Not Completed Withdrawal by Subject 4 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT03883581; ﻿30 patients with ALS assessed for eligibility between August 26, 2019 August 16, 2021 28 Enrolled/consented to treatment 2 Excluded • 2 Did not meet criteria 24 Completed 30-day Nuedexta treatment 4 Did not complete Nuedexta intervention Unrelated Hospitalization, n=1 .

Richard Smith, Erik Pioro, Kathleen Myers, Michael Sirdofsky, Kimberly Goslin, Gregg Meekins, Hong Yu, James Wymer, Merit Cudkowicz, Eric A. Macklin, David Schoenfeld, Gary Pattee Enhanced Bulbar Function in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: The Nuedexta Treatment Trial. Results: The CNS-BFS score improved with active treatment, decreasing from a mean of 59.3 in the placebo arm of the trial to 53.5 during the drug-treatment arm (p < 0.001). Each of the individual domains of bulbar function interrogated by the CNS-BFS responded to treatment with Nuedexta as follows: salivation: 15.8 versus 14.3 (p = 0.004); speech: 24.6 versus 22.2 (p = 0.003); swallowing: 18.9 versus 17.1 (p = 0.009). Similarly, the bulbar component of the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised improved with active treatment (p = 0.003), although the drug did not affect the motor and respiratory components of this scale. Conclusion: This study is unique for several reasons. Firstly, it was driven by patient reports of improved speech and swallowing while taking Nuedexta for control of emotional lability. Secondly, the study was conducted over a short duration (70 days), and thirdly, a self-report scale was selected as the principle outcome measure. Considering the importance of bulbar functions, these results, if confirmed, point to an additional use of Nuedexta as an adjunct to the management of ALS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28070747 [Full text is available at:] https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13311-016-0508-5.pdf; March 4, 2016 Presented at the 68th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 15-21, 2016, Vancouver, Canada Abstract #: P2.224 Richard Smith,Erik Pioro,David Schoenfeld,Gary Pattee The Nuedexta ALS Treatment Trial Results: The mean CNS-BFS score for the treatment group was 53.45 versus 59.31 in the placebo group, a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0003). All three domains of bulbar function—speech, swallowing, and salivation—responded positively to treatment. Approximately half the patients exhibited pseudobulbar affect (PBA). Treatment effect was independent of the patients’ PBA status. Both speech rate and swallowing time responded to treatment, although neither was statistically significant. Conclusion: In conclusion, Nuedexta palliates bulbar symptoms in patients with ALS. More extensive studies will be required to determine the duration of the treatment effect, and the possibility that Nuedexta is a disease-modifying agent. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4046/presentation/5938","Secondary Outcome Measures: Center for Neurologic Study - Lability Scale (CNS-LS) Total Score [ Time Frame: Average between Screening Visit to Visit 3 ] The Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is a 7-item self report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA) by measuring the perceived frequency of PBA episodes (laughing or crying).

ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R) Total Score [ Time Frame: Average between Screening Visit to Visit 3 ] The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 min) ordinal rating scale used to determine a subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There are 12 questions, graded by the subject 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing. Visual Analog Scale - Speech Scores [ Time Frame: Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3 ] Visual analog scales are useful for measuring complex clinical events and offer the advantage of self-administration and responsiveness to change over time. The scales designed for this study inventory three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). For each of these, subjects score themselves by indicating their level of function on a scale of 1 (severe impairment) to 10 (normal). Scores range from 1 to 10; the higher the score, the more normal the function. Ashworth Spasticity Scale Score - Right Arm [ Time Frame: Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3 ] This is a standard measure for spasticity that has been used in numerous ALS clinical trials to assess spasticity due to upper motor neuron dysfunction in ALS. Data is generated from the clinical exam and scored from 1-5, the lowest score indicating normal tone and the highest muscle rigidity. Timed Reading of Test Paragraph Result [ Time Frame: Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3 ] Subjects will be asked to read 'The Rainbow Passage' a commonly used test paragraph utilized by speech pathologists to assess speech rate (words/minute). Study staff will time the subject to determine how many words the subject reads per minute. It is used primarily because it contains every sound in the English language. Subjects will also be observed for loudness, nasality, and intelligibility. Average Water Swallowing Test (WST) [ Time Frame: Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3 ] The Water Swallowing Test (WST) estimates swallowing speed, a useful and reproducible measure. While sitting, subjects are asked to drink 30 milliliters (mL) of liquid. The time for subjects to complete this task is a sensitive measure for the detection of swallowing dysfunction and is a simple measure for serial assessment of subjects. The test will be completed three times, with the best two scores recorded to obtain an average score. Following completion of the WST, the subject's swallowing abilities (choking, spillage, and effort) will be observed.

Scores range from 1 to 10; the higher the score, the more normal the function. Average Solids Swallowing Test [ Time Frame: Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3 ] The Time Swallowing Test assesses the subject's ability to swallow solids. For this test, the subject will be asked to consume a tablespoon of cereal containing 5 cheerios. The subject will be instructed to close their mouth, chew and subsequently swallow the bolus. The time to complete this task will be recorded. The test will be completed three times to obtain an average score.

Desai, K. Amy Wright, Velma L. Langford, Nicole M. Williams, Mohammed S. Sanjak and Richard A. Smith; Charlotte, NC and La Jolla Bulbar Speech-Articulation/Swallowing Rate Changes Measured in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients Treated with Dextromethorphan/ Quinidine(Nuedexta) for Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) – Determination of Treatment Effect Size for Future Clinical Trials Results: Labial [pre-46.1+ or - 648. post-60.2+ or - 53.1:paired-t-test-p =0.0003] articulation rates [normal-198.3+ or - 55.2 words/min/breath] increased significantly. Swallowing rates [pre-97.6+ or - 6100.3/post-104.7+ or - 690.9; paired-t-test-p =0.02] increased significantly[normal-220+ or - 46 mL/minute/swallow/ breath]. Rate improvements did not correlate with changes in ALSFRS-R, vtial capacity or other clinimetrics. Conclusion: Bulbar speech-articulation/swallowing rates improved over 2-9 months in ALS/PBA patients having abnormal speech-articulation rates [3-132 words/minute/ breath]. Treatment effect size for bulbar speech-articulation/ swallowing rates will permit sample-size determination to employ these outcomes for future controlled clinical trials of Nuedexta on bulbar function in ALS patients. Improved speech/swallowing seen in ALS/PBA patients on Nuedexta requires evaluation in bulbar ALS patients without PBA. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical importance and significance of these observations. http://www.aneuroa.org/files/2012%20Annual%20Meeting/ANA%202012%20Abstract%20Book.pdf (Page#99/206)",,TrialTroveID-175656,,,,175656,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,,,Iv,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

The overall AE rate was 73.5%; rates calculated by previous treatment group were 72.3%, 75.0 %, and 73.5% for DMQ30, DMQ20, and placebo, respectively. Treatment-related incidence was 28.1% overall and 24.5%, 27.6%, and 32.5% by previous treatment group. Serious AEs were reported by 5.5% overall and by 6.4%, 6.6%, and 3.6% of the groups previously treated with DMQ30, DMQ20, and placebo. AE-related discontinuations occurred in 4.3% overall and in 6.4% for DMQ30, 3.9% for DMQ20, and 2.4% for placebo. Conclusions: DMQ30 appears safe and well-tolerated in patients treated up to 24 weeks.

By Week 1 significantly more patients receiving DMQ-30 (74.8%; P=0.01) and DMQ-20 (73.7%; P=0.02) met onset criteria vs placebo (57.3%). At subsequent timepoints, progressively greater percentages in all groups met onset criteria, reaching 100% by week 12 and indicating the prespecified onset criterion was insufficiently stringent. Thus a post-hoc analysis of percent change in PBA episodes by week was conducted to further explore onset. By week 1, PBA episodes decreased by 47% (DMQ-30;P=0.004), and 50% (DMQ-20;P=0.001) vs 23% (placebo); differences in both DMQ groups remained significant vs. placebo at all subsequent visits. Conclusions: DMQ-30 and DMQ-20 demonstrated rapid onset of action to decrease PBA episodes, with significant differences over placebo by week 1 of treatment. http://www.cmellc.com/psychcongress/2011/abstracts/135.html; October 20, 2011 Presented at the 5th Joint Triennial Congress of the European and Americas Committees on Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis,October 19-22, 2011, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract No: P564 A. Rae-Grant, C. Lovelace, A. Formella Safety and tolerability of dextromethorphan/quinidine for pseudobulbar affect in patients with multiple sclerosis during a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Results: Of 326 randomized patients, 129 (39.6%) had multiple sclerosis. In this multiple sclerosis subpopulation patients experienced a mean baseline of 3.16 to 3.95 episodes of laughing/crying per day; 93.3% of DMQ 30/10 (42 of 45 patients), 89.7% of DMQ 20/10 mg (35 of 39 patients), and 86.7% of the placebo group (39 of 45) completed the study. The most common AEs (> or =;5% in any treatment group for the overall trial population) for multiple sclerosis patients were dizziness (17.8%, 7.7%, and 2.2% for 30/10, 20/10, and placebo, respectively), nausea (13.3%, 0.0%, 6.7%), headache (11.1%, 20.5%, 11.1%), diarrhea (11.1%, 5.1%, 2.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.1%, 2.6%, 4.4%), somnolence (10.0%, 8.4%, 9.2%), fall (8.9%, 10.3%, 8.9%), fatigue (0.0%, 10.3%, 11.1%), muscle spasm (2.2%, 2.6%, 2.2%) and constipation (2.2%, 0.0%, 0.0%).

Pioro, Benjamin Rix Brooks, Jeffrey Cummings, Randolph Schiffer, Ronald A. Thisted, Daniel Wynn, Adrian Hepner, Randall Kaye Dextromethorphan Plus Ultra Low-Dose Quinidine Reduces Pseudobulbar Affect Results: In 326 randomized patients (of whom 283, or 86.8%, completed the study), the PBA-episode daily rate was 46.9% (p < 0.0001) lower for DMq-30 than for placebo and 49.0% (p < 0.0001) lower for DMq-20 than for placebo by longitudinal negative binomial regression, the prespecified primary analysis. Mean CNS-LS scores decreased by 8.2 points for DMq-30 and 8.2 for DMq-20, vs 5.7 for placebo (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0113, respectively). Other endpoints showing statistically significant DMq benefit included, for both dosage levels, the likelihood of PBA remission during the final 14 days and, for the higher dosage, improvement on measures of social functioning and mental health. Both dosages were safe and well tolerated. Interpretation: DMq markedly reduced PBA frequency and severity, decreasing the condition's detrimental impact on a patient's life, with satisfactory safety and high tolerability. The findings expand the clinical evidence that DMq may be an important treatment for patients suffering from the socially debilitating symptoms of PBA. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20839238 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.22093/abstract; June 4, 2010 Presented at 24th Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), jointly with the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), June 2-5, 2010, San Antonio, TX Poster Presentations Abstract# S150 D. Wynn, R. Schiffer, B. Brooks, E.P. Pioro, J. Cummings, A. Hepner, R. Kaye DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, MULTINATIONAL STUDY OF AVP-923 FOR PSEUDOBULBAR AFFECT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Results: Of 326 subjects, 129 had underlying MS. At baseline, they suffered, on average, >3 PBA episodes per day and had an average CNS-LS score of approximately 20. In the longitudinal analysis of PBA rate, the therapeutic effect relative to placebo was signifi cant in the higher-dose group (P = .0280). A generalized estimating equation analysis showed a trend for superiority in both DMq groups (P = .0647 and P = .0527). Reductions in mean CNS-LS score were demonstrated for both DMq groups (vs. placebo) but did not reach statistical signifi cance. In the higher-dose group, mean pain scores across time and means at days 15 and 29 showed trends for superiority over placebo (P = .0512 and P = .0859). The most common adverse events more frequent in the DMq groups than in the placebo group were dizziness, diarrhea, and somnolence. One patient in the higher-dose group and two in the placebo group reported nonfatal serious adverse events. Conclusions: At both doses, effi cacy results resembled those in previous studies of DMq containing quinidine at a higher dose, and safety and tolerability were improved. http://annualmeeting.mscare.org/images/pdf/2010/2010abstracts.pdf (Page: 193); April 15, 2010 Presented at 62nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 10-17, 2010, Toronto, Canada Abstract No: P06.119 Randall Kaye, Craig Pratt Summary of Cardiac Safety from a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Trial of Dextromethorphan/Quinidine (STAR) for Treatment of Pseudobulbar Affect Results: Three hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled (110 on DMQ30, 107 on DMQ20, and 109 on placebo). Small changes from baseline in mean QTcF (Fridericia's correction) interval (msec) were observed and varied across study visits. For DMQ30, DMQ20, and placebo, respectively, week 12 changes were 4.9, 1.2, and 1.1. No patients treated with DMQ had QTcF interval increases >60 msec or absolute QTcF interval >480 msec. There were no serious cardiac-related adverse events reported. Conclusions: Very low doses of quinidine led to small changes in QT interval. DMQ appears to have low pro-arrhythmic potential. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_P06.119; October 09, 2009 The 3rd World Congress on Controversies in Neurology (CONy), October 8-11, 2009 D. Wynn Clinical Aspects of Pseudobulbar Affect and Clinical Trials, including STAR Results: DM/Q was well-tolerated. The overall adverse event incidence rate was 81.6% in the DM/Q group and 85.1% in the placebo group. Adverse -event-related withdrawals occurred in 14.5% of the DM/Q group and 10.8% of the placebo group. The most common adverse events reported by a greater number of DM/Q-treated patients were dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Headache was the most common event overall but was reported at nearly twice the incidence in placebo-treated patients (29.7% versus 15.8% for DM/Q). Conclusions: The promising results from the Panitch et al. trial led to the evaluation of additional dose formulations of DM/Q for PBA (the STAR trial). This 12-week, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated 326 patients with PBA (129 with MS and 197 with ALS) treated with DM/Q 30/10 mg, DM/Q 20/10 mg, or placebo. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the daily rate of laughing and crying episodes from the patient diary. Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes from baseline in CNS-LS scores and Pain Rating Scale scores (MS patients only). Efficacy and safety results from the total population and the MS subset will be reported during the presentation. http://comtecmed.com/cony/2009/sab.aspx#121","Secondary Outcome Measures: Mean Change From Baseline in CNS-LS Total Score by Visit [ Time Frame: Baseline, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 84 ] -Center for Neurologic Studies-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is an instrument for the measurement of PBA that has been validated for the use in patients with ALS and MS. It is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the frequency and severity of PBA episodes, including assessments of labile laughter and labile tearfulness,and provides a score for total PBA (total score can range from 7-35). The following 5-point scoring was used: 1=Applies never, 2=Applies rarely, 3=Applies occasionally, 4=Applies frequently, 5=Applies most of the time. A score of 13 or higher may suggest PBA, and the higher the score the more severe the episodes. Mean Change From Baseline to Day 84 in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q) Frequency and Severity Score (EE Population) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Day 84 ] - The NPI is a retrospective (to 1 month) caregiver-informant interview assessing frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. The NPI score is based on the sum of the severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild, 3=severe). The 12 symptom domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. The NPI severity score is based on severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild to 3=severe). Mean Change From Baseline to Day 84 in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q) Frequency and Severity Score (ITT Population) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Day 84 ] -The NPI is a retrospective (to 1 month) caregiver-informant interview assessing frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. The NPI score is based on the sum of the severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild, 3=severe). The 12 symptom domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. The NPI severity score is based on severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild to 3=severe). Mean Change From Baseline at Day 84 in SF-36 (Short-Form) Health Survey Medical Outcome Score by Category [ Time Frame: Baseline and Day 84 ] -The SF-36 is designed to examine a person's perceived health status. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale measuring eight health concepts: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role-, emotional role-, social role functioning, and mental health. Answers to each question are scored and summed to produce raw scale scores for each health concept which are then transformed to a 0 - 100 scale, a high score defining a more favorable health state. An aggregate summary measure is calculated by averaging the scores from the eight health concepts. Mean Change From Baseline at Day 84 in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Total Score [ Time Frame: Baseline and Day 84 ] -The BDI-II is a 21-item self report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression, summed to give a single score. The BDI-II uses a 4-point for each item ranging from 0 to 3. A total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14 to 19 is mild, 20 to 28 is moderate, and 29 to 63 is severe. Mean Change From Baseline to Day 84 in Pain Rating Scale (PRS) of MS Subjects [ Time Frame: Baseline, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 84 ] -Subjects with MS were instructed to also record daily the pain they experienced using the PRS. After evaluating the subject's ability to comply with these requirements, the investigator determined if a caregiver should complete the study diary and assessments. Subjects rated their pain over the past 12 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=none, 10=worst pain ever experienced). Secondary endpoints include: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q).

[Epub ahead of print] Accepted: June 26, 2014; published online: July 28, 2014 Pattee GL, Wymer JP, Lomen-Hoerth C, Appel SH, Formella AE, Pope LE. An open-label multicenter study to assess the safety of dextromethorphan/quinidine in patients with pseudobulbar affect associated with a range of underlying neurological conditions. Results: A total of 553 PBA patients with >30 different neurological conditions enrolled; 296 (53.5%) completed. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were nausea (11.8%), dizziness (10.5%), headache (9.9%), somnolence (7.2%), fatigue (7.1%), diarrhea (6.5%), and dry mouth (5.1%). TRAEs were mostly mild/moderate, generally transient, and consistent with previous controlled trials. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 126 patients (22.8%), including 47 deaths, mostly due to ALS progression and respiratory failure. No SAEs were deemed related to DM/Q treatment by investigators. ECG results suggested no clinically meaningful effect of DM/Q on myocardial repolarization. Differences in AEs across neurological disease groups appeared consistent with the known morbidity of the primary neurological conditions. Study interpretation is limited by the small size of some disease groups, the lack of a specific efficacy measure and the use of a DM/Q dose higher than the eventually approved dose. Conclusions: DM/Q was generally well tolerated over this 52 week trial in patients with PBA associated with a wide range of neurological conditions. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25062507 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1185/03007995.2014.940040 Full text available at: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1185/03007995.2014.940040; May 17, 2011 Presented at the 164th Annual American Psychiatric Association Meeting, May 14-18, 2011, Honolulu, HI Abstract No: NR09-70 Laura Pope Ph.D., Adrian Hepner, M.D., Randall Kaye, M.D. Evaluation of the Safety of Dextromethorphan/Quinidine for Treatment of Pseudobulbar Affect in Patients Across a Rangeof Neurological Conditions. Results: Common underlying conditions in the 553 treated PBA patients were: MS (40.3%); ALS (31.8%); stroke (8.3%); traumatic brain injury (3.8%); primary lateral sclerosis (2.9%); Parkinson’s disease (2.7%); and Alzheimer’s disease (2.5%). Three hundred patients (54.2%) completed > or =1 year, and 382 (69.1%) completed > or =6 months of treatment. AEs were reported in 508/553 (91.9%) in the treatment phase and 227/262 (86.6%) in the extension. The nature, frequency, and intensity of AEs were generally reflective of a population with serious neurological conditions. The most common AEs during the treatment phase included nausea (24.8%); headache (22.8%); dizziness (excluding vertigo; 19.5%); fall (16.5%); diarrhea (16.3%); fatigue (14.6%); and weakness (13.7%). The most common AEs during the extension phase included fall (18.7%); nasopharyngitis (18.3%); headache (16.4%); and arthralgia (14.5%). SAEs were reported in 22.8% in the treatment phase and 29.4% in extension phase; none were considered treatment-related. Discontinuations due to AEs were 26.9% in the treatment phase and 14.9% in the extension phase. A total of 47 patients died during the treatment phase and 32 during the extension phase. Most deaths were associated with progression of ALS; of the 79 patients who died, 64 had ALS, and the remaining 15 had other pathology of the central nervous system. None of the deaths was judged to be related to study drug. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs or physical examination results. Two patients had a QTc value > or =500 ms during the extension phase. Overall ECG results suggested DMQ had no clinically meaningful effects on myocardial repolarization nor on any other ECG variable. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with DMQ 30/30 appeared safe and well tolerated in patients with PBA. Consistent with expected clinical course of the conditions underlying PBA, SAEs and death by natural causes occurred in this study population.

Arnold, San Diego, James Berg, San Diego, CA Long-Term Safety of AVP-923 (Dextromethorphan/Quinidine) in the Treatment of Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED) Results: More than 30 underlying neurological conditions were represented. The mean duration of dosing was 258.6 days and median compliance rate was 97.1%. The most frequently reported AEs during the 52 week treatment phase included nausea (23.9%), headache (22.3%), dizziness (18.8%), diarrhea (16.2%), and fatigue (13.8%). Most AEs were mild to moderate in nature and reported in the first week of therapy with decreasing frequency over time. There were no clinically important differences in AE frequencies among the subgroups of sex, age, or race. Electrocardiographic results suggested no clinically meaningful effect of AVP-923 on cardiac repolarization or any ECG variable. There were no SAEs related to use of AVP-923 per investigators and the medical monitor. Conclusions/Relevance: AVP-923 appears safe in the long-term treatment of patients with IEED. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2007boston/view.php?nu=AAN07L_P01.015&terms=",,02-AVR-107 NCT00056524 TrialTroveID-005588,Primary Outcomes: Emotional control.,"553 patients treated with DM/Q, 382 patients (69.1%) Completed at least 6 months of treatment, 300 (54.2%) Completed 1 year, and 296 (53.5%) completed the Protocol specified visits.

In Group 1, AVP-786 coadministration increased steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) of PRX 1.64 fold and Cmax 1.49 fold vs PRX alone. Likewise, in Group 2, PRX coadministration increased the AUC and Cmax of the AVP-786 components d6-DM (2.18 fold and 1.81 fold) and Q (1.33 fold and 1.25 fold) with a corresponding decrease in exposure to the d3-DX metabolite (AUC decrease 28.4%; Cmax decrease 32.9%) compared with AVP- 786 alone. In Group 3, AVP-786 coadministration increased steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) of DUL 1.84 fold and Cmax 1.68 fold vs DUL alone. In Group 4 DUL did not appreciably affect the d6-DM or Q component of AVP-786 nor the d3-DX metabolite. The percentages of subjects reporting any AE on monotherapy vs. combination therapy were: Group 1: 50% vs. 83%, Group 2: 64% vs. 93%, Group 3: 43% vs. 50% and Group 4: 50% vs. 50%. The most commonly reported AEs in Groups 1 and 2 (AVP-786 and PRX) were dizziness, diarrhea, nausea. The most commonly reported AEs in Groups 3 and 4 (AVP-786 and DUL) were fatigue and muscle tightness. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG assessments showed no clear safety differences between treatments. Conclusions: This phase 1 study showed that AVP-786 coadministration increased systemic exposure to PRX (~1.6 fold) and DUL (~1.8 fold) compared with either drug alone. Likewise, PRX increased exposure (~2.2 fold) to the d6-DM, component of AVP-786 with a corresponding decrease (~28%) in d3-DX metabolite exposure; Q exposure was modestly increased (~33%). DUL did not appear to affect exposure to d6-DM, its metabolite or Q.

Schoedel KA, Pope LE, Sellers EM. Randomized open-label drug-drug interaction trial of dextromethorphan/quinidine and paroxetine in healthy volunteers. Results: The 90% CIs of the AUCs were outside of the predefined range [0.80, 1.25] for all analytes, indicating a drug-drug interaction. In group 1 (n=14), addition of DMQ to paroxetine resulted in a 30% increase in mean plasma exposure of paroxetine (AUC up to 24 hours). In group 2 (n=13), addition of paroxetine to DMQ resulted in increases in mean plasma exposure (AUC up to 12 hours) of 50% for DM and 40% for Q, and a decrease of 12.3% for dextrorphan, the metabolite of DM. The incidence of AEs was higher with paroxetine monotherapy and combination therapy, compared with DMQ given alone (30.8% with DMQ alone vs 83.3% following addition of paroxetine, and 78.6% with paroxetine alone vs 64.3% following addition of DMQ). Three subjects discontinued due to AEs, and no serious AEs were reported. Conclusion: The addition of DMQ 30mg/30mg twice daily to paroxetine increased steady-state paroxetine plasma concentrations and addition of paroxetine to DMQ 30mg/30mg twice daily increased steady-state plasma concentrations of DM and Q, indicating a potential interaction. Thus, patients should be monitored for AEs and dosage adjustment considered when combining these two agents. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22283559 http://adisonline.com/druginvestigation/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2012&issue=32030&article=00002&type=abstract; May 24, 2010 Presented at 163rd Annual American Psychiatric Association, May 22-26, 2010, New Orleans, LA Abstract No. NR3-26 Kerri Schoedel, Ph.D., Laura E.

Sellers, M.D., Ph.D. A Drug Interaction Study Of Dextromethorphan/Quinidine: An Investigational Agent For Pseudobulbar Affect And Paroxetine Results: The 90% CIs of the AUCs were outside the predefined range [0.8, 1.25] for all analyses indicating an interaction. At steady state, addition of DMQ to P resulted in increased levels of P, and addition of P to DMQ resulted in increased levels of DM and Q. The mean increase was 30% for P (AUC0-24), 50% for DM (AUC0-12), and 40% for Q (AUC0-12). A subgroup analysis that excluded outliers found similar increases except for P, where a 70% increase in AUC0-24 was demonstrated. Incidence of AEs was increased when P was added to DMQ (30.8% for DMQ alone vs 83.3% with P+DMQ); however, addition of DMQ to P was associated with lower AE incidence (78.6% with P alone vs 64.3% with DMQ+P). Overall, 3 subjects discontinued due to AEs and no serious AEs were reported. Conclusions: Drug interactions between DMQ and paroxetine resulted in an increased incidence of AEs in some subjects.

Troyer The integrated stress response is modulated by eIF2B agonist DNL343: results from phase 1 healthy subject and phase 1b ALS patient studies Results: In the Phase 1 study, DNL343 was generally safe and well-tolerated, showed extensive CSF distribution and a long half-life (38–46 hours) supporting once-daily dosing, and showed potent ISR biomarker responses in all MAD cohorts. Similarly, in the Phase 1b DB study, DNL343 was generally safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. DNL343 plasma concentrations were dose-dependent and had similar concentrations in CSF as in plasma with a ratio of 1.2. DNL343 robustly attenuated two ISR biomarkers (CHAC1 [56–85%] and ATF4 [73–79%]) in the DNL343 treated cohorts. In the ONC model, we showed that DNL343 suppresses ISR biomarkers and that RGC survival improved. New clinical bio- marker data will be presented. Conclusions: In Phase 1 and 1b studies, DNL343 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses that demonstrate robust inhibition of ISR (CHAC1 and ATF4). Human pharmacokinetic profiles support once-daily oral dosing and along with pre- clinical in vivo data are consistent with extensive CNS distri- bution. Previously, we showed that DNL343 attenuates ISR activation and motor function decline brought on by an 212 Clinical Trials and Trial Design 34th International Symposium on ALS/MND eIF2B loss-of-function mutation in mice. In previously unpub- lished experiments, we show DNL343 can also reduce ISR activation caused by an optic nerve crush injury. This effect is linked to improvement in survival of axotomized RGCs, supporting a neuroprotective effect of DNL343. These data support further development of DNL343 as a novel investiga- tional therapeutic for the treatment of ALS. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; March 2, 2023 [Pooled analysis] AAN 2023 Available online date: March 2, 2023 Linus Sun Richard Tsai Ernie Yulyaningsih Melania Fanok Maurits Vissers Jules Heuberger Brittany Flores Fen Huang Lesley Kane Isaac Cohen Shyeilla Dhuria Meng Fang Anthony Estrada Maksim Osipov Brent Willman-Yoswa Romeo Maciuca Sarah Dobbins Ronnie Chau Timothy Earr Hoang Nguyen Isabel Lopez Kimberly Scearce-Levie Tommy Bunte Leonard Van den Berg Carole Ho Geert-Jan Groeneveld Matthew Troyer The Integrated Stress Response Is Modulated by eIF2B Agonist DNL343: Results From Phase 1 Healthy Subject and Phase 1b ALS Patient Studies. Results: In the Phase 1 study, ninety-five healthy participants were randomized (n=48 SAD, n=47 MAD). DNL343 was generally safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations related to study drug. DNL343 plasma concentrations were dose-dependent, with a plasma half-life of 38-46 hours and CSF-to-unbound plasma concentration ratio of 0.66-0.92. DNL343 attenuated two ISR biomarkers across the dosing period and at trough 24-hours after the last dose (CHAC1 [66-94%] and ATF4 [50-73%]) in all MAD cohorts. Safety, pharmacokinetics and ISR pharmacodynamics from the 28-day Phase 1b study in ALS participants will be presented. Conclusions: DNL343 is generally safe and well-tolerated at doses that demonstrate robust inhibition of ISR through CHAC1 and ATF4 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic profile supports once daily oral dosing and there is extensive CSF distribution. Data from these early-stage studies in HV and ALS patients support further development of DNL343 as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of ALS. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-003555.html; DNL343 (eIF2B ACTIVATOR): INHIBITING THE ISR PATHWAY IN ALS [Interim data] 28-day dosing with DNL343 reduced ISR biomarkers in blood samples* from ALS patients By inhibiting the ISR pathway, DNL343 is intended to prevent or slow ALS progression ~250,000 people with ALS WW • eIF2B regulates protein synthesis and is required for neuronal health and function • When neurons experience stress, activation of the ISR pathway leads to suppression of eIF2B • Suppression of eIF2B leads to impaired protein synthesis and formation of stress granules • Stress granules are thought to be a precursor of TDP-43 aggregation, a hallmark pathology of ALS • DNL343 is designed to activate eIF2B and avert the deleterious effects of chronic ISR activation https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/Denali%20Corporate%20Deck_JPM_January%202023.pdf; December 5, 2022 [Press release] [Interim results] Denali Therapeutics Announces DNL343 Interim Phase 1b Data in ALS and Entry into the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial DNL343 demonstrated extensive blood-brain barrier penetration and robustly inhibited the integrated stress response pathway implicated in ALS Once-daily oral dosing with DNL343 for 28 days was generally well tolerated in participants with ALS ...SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 05, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Denali Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: DNLI), a biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of product candidates engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for neurodegenerative diseases and lysosomal storage disorders, today announced interim results from a Phase 1b study of its eIF2B agonist, DNL343, in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Once-daily oral dosing with DNL343 for 28 days was generally well tolerated and demonstrated extensive BBB penetration as well as robust inhibition of biomarkers associated with the integrated stress response (ISR) in blood samples from study participants. By inhibiting the ISR pathway, DNL343 is intended to prevent or slow disease progression associated with stress granule formation and TDP-43 aggregation, a hallmark pathology present in nearly all individuals with ALS. The Phase 1b results will be presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, which is being held virtually December 6-9, 2022... ...About the Phase 1b study in ALS ...In the interim analysis, DNL343 demonstrated dose-dependent increases in plasma concentrations and a long plasma half-life, supporting once-daily dosing. The mean ratio of drug in cerebrospinal fluid compared to unbound drug in plasma ranged from 1.02–1.23, suggesting that DNL343 effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier and is extensively distributed to the central nervous system. Robust inhibition of ISR was noted, as measured by attenuation of the ISR pathway biomarkers (ATF4 and CHAC1) in blood samples. DNL343 was generally well tolerated in participants with ALS in this study... https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/investors/press-release?id=9081&type=api; November 17, 2022 [Pooled Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No.:CLT-09 The integrated stress response is modulated by elF2B agonist DNL343: results from preclinical, phase 1 healthy subject and interim phase 1b ALS patient studies 137 Results: In the completed Phase 1 trial, ninety-five healthy participants were randomized (n¼ 48 in SAD, n¼ 47 in MAD). DNL343 achieved robust inhibition of CHAC1 gene expression (66–94%) and ATF4 protein levels (50–73%) 24 hours after the last dose for all doses studied in the MAD cohorts. DNL343 plasma concentration increased in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean plasma half-life of 40–50 hours and a mean CSF-to-unbound plasma concentration ratio ranging from 0.66 to 0.92 across the dose range. DNL343 was generally safe and well tolerated with no dose related trends in safety parameters and no serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations due to AEs. Interim safety, PK and PD data from the ongoing Ph1b study in ALS patients will be presented. Conclusion: DNL343 has been generally safe and well-tolerated in Phase 1 studies to date. PK data demonstrate high CSF penetration and support once daily dosing. PD assessments show robust inhibition of ISR biomarkers CHAC1 and ATF4. Preclinical data, CSF penetration and pathway engagement in clinical studies suggest DNL343 has the potential to decrease CNS ISR activity and stress granules in ALS patients. This pathway is under investigation as a potential disease modifying approach to TDP-43 accumulation. These early data support continued clinical investigation of DNL343 in ALS.

Single doses of intravenously administered TAK-594/DNL593 were generally safe and well tolerated. There were no discontinuations related to drug. The majority of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild to moderate, and no infusion related reactions were observed. TAK-594/DNL593 serum exposures increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner with low to moderate variability in PK parameters. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total PGRN concentration, sampled 24 hours post-infusion, also increased dose dependently above baseline levels. Conclusion: Single dose safety and PK of TAK-594/DNL593 in healthy participants support initiation of the multiple dose study in participants with FTD-GRN. The dose-dependent increase in CSF PGRN is consistent with delivery of TAK-594/DNL593 across the BBB and supports the potential of TAK-594/DNL593 to treat FTD-GRN. https://alz.confex.com/alz/2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/75068; Ph1/2 Study of TAK-594/DNL593 in Healthy Volunteers and Participants with FTD-GRN: Update on Ph1 Healthy Volunteer Safety and PK Results ONGOING PART A SINGLE DOSE HEALTHY VOLUNTEER SAFETY DATA Preliminary, blinded data cut on 6 Aug 2022 • Single doses of TAK-594/DNL593 up to cohort A5 dose (30X escalation) were generally safe and well tolerated • N=35 healthy participants treated with single dose TAK-594/DNL593 or placebo • 21 TEAEs in 18 participants – 1 SAE of ureteric stone, not related to study drug – No AEs leading to study withdrawal – No infusion related reactions – 14 mild AEs, 6 moderate AEs, 1 severe AE (SAE of ureteric stone) – TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2 participants (%N) • Post LP syndrome (headache), n=7 (20%); dizziness, n = 2 (6%); headache n = 2 (6%) • No clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical/neurological exam, ECG, or safety labs • No dose-related trends in safety assessments Summary TAK-594/DNL593 is an investigational, peripherally administered recombinant PGRN fusion protein designed to replace the reduced PGRN in FTD caused by GRN gene mutations • Chronic treatment with TAK-594/DNL593 in Grn KO mice corrected biomarkers of lysosomal function, inflammation, and neurodegeneration • In the ongoing Part A healthy volunteer portion of the Ph1/2 trial • Single doses evaluated so far are generally safe and well tolerated • CSF PGRN increased dose-dependently (up to 26X of baseline) consistent with brain delivery of TAK-594/DNL593 in humans • Enrollment has begun for patients with FTD-GRN in Part B (6mo double-blind) followed by Part C (18mo open-label) of the Ph1/2 trial. https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/sites/default/files/2022-11/Nov2022%20DNL593%20Ph1%20HV%20Data%20Presentation_Final_0.pdf; November 1, 2022 [Press release] [Interim results] Denali Therapeutics Announces Phase 1/2 Study Single Dose Healthy Volunteer Data with TAK-594/DNL593 (PTV:PGRN) and Progression to Enrolling Participants with FTD-GRN - Interim results from Part A in healthy volunteers demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CSF progranulin levels, consistent with robust brain delivery of DNL593 - Single doses of DNL593 were generally well tolerated - Data support progression to enrolling participants with FTD-GRN in Part B of the Phase 1/2 study SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 01, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Denali Therapeutics Inc.

Most common AEs were dizziness and headache. No clinically meaningful changes were noted in laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters. SAR443820 had a favorable PK profile, with plasma half-lives (geometric mean) ranged between 5.7-8.0 h and 7.2-8.9 h after single and repeated doses, respectively. There were no major deviations from dose proportionality for maximum concentration and area under the curve across SAR443820 doses. Mean CSF-to-unbound plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.8 to 1.3 over time (assessed up to 10 h post dose), indicating high brain penetrance. Conclusion: High levels of inhibition of activated RIPK1, as measured by decrease in pS166-RIPK1, were achieved in both SAD and MAD parts, with a maximum median inhibition from baseline close to 90% at predose (Ctrough ) after multiple dosing in MAD, reflecting a marked RIPK1 target engagement at the peripheral level.

Most common AEs were dizziness and headache. No clinically meaningful changes were noted in hematology, chemistry, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters. There were no major deviations from dose proportionality for maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) over the range of SAR443820 doses. Mean plasma half-lives ranged between 6-8h and 7-9h in SAD and MAD cohorts, respectively. Mean CSF-to-unbound plasma concentration ratio suggested high CNS-penetrance. Concentration-QTcF analyses did not indicate any potential for SAR443820 to cause relevant change in QTcF. Maximum median inhibition of phosphorylated-Ser166-RIPK1 levels across all SAR443820 groups reflected a marked target engagement. Conclusions: The first-in-human study demonstrated that single and repeated SAR443820 doses were generally safe and well-tolerated, with favorable pharmacokinetics, high CNS-penetrance, and robust RIPK1-target engagement, supporting further development in actively recruiting Phase 2 trials in ALS (Himalaya; NCT05237284) and MS (K2; ACT16753). https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-001927.html; January 10, 2023 Denali Corporate Overview Robust target engagement goals and safety goals were achieved in Phase 1 studies for SAR443820 93% to 99% RIPK1 inhibition achieved in Phase 1 after multiple doses of SAR443820* *Maximum median inhibition of pS66-RIPK1 levels in blood cells from healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 study ranged from 93% to 99% [See source URL for tabular data:] https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/Denali%20Corporate%20Deck_JPM_January%202023.pdf",Secondary Outcome Measures : Parts 1a and 1b: Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: Cmax in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 ] Parts 1a and 1b: Maximum plasma concentration Parts 1a and 1b: Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: tmax in plasma [ Time Frame: Day 1 ] Parts 1a and 1b: time to reach Cmax Parts 1a and 1b : Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: AUC in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 ] Parts 1a and 1b: Area under the plasma concentration versus time Parts 1a and 1b : Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: t1/2z in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 ] Terminal half-life in plasma Part1b: SAR443820 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples [ Time Frame: Day1 ] Part 1b: CSF to plasma concentration ratio Part 2: Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: Cmax in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 and Day14 ] Part 2: Maximum plasma concentration Part 2: Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: tmax in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 and Day14 ] Part 2: Time to reach Cmax Part 2: Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: AUC tau in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 and Day14 ] Part 2: Area under the plasma concentration versus time during a dosing interval Part 2 Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter of SAR443820: t1/2z in plasma [ Time Frame: Day14 ] Terminal half-life in plasma Part 2: Day14/Day1 of 4β-hydroxycholesterol ratio in plasma [ Time Frame: Day1 and Day14 ] D14/D1 of 4β-hydroxycholesterol ratio,NCT05795907 TDU16519-TDR16520 TrialTroveID-458128 U1111-1254-0034,Primary Outcome Measures : Parts 1a and 1b: Number of participants with adverse events [ Time Frame: Day1 up to Day 7 (end of study visit) ] Part 2: Number of participants with adverse events [ Time Frame: Day1 up to Day 21 (end of study visit) ],[Refer Figure 1 from below URL] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10772668/pdf/CTS-17-e13690.pdf,Area under the curve score Cmax Elimination half-life Plasma concentration Tmax,458128,Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions,Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics,"January 10, 2023 Robust target engagement goals and safety goals were achieved in Phase 1 studies for SAR443820 93% to 99% RIPK1 inhibition achieved in Phase 1 after multiple doses of SAR443820* [See source URL for tabular data:] https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/Denali%20Corporate%20Deck_JPM_January%202023.pdf",I,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",1,8,0,2,1,10,22,PHARMACOKINETIC,1,0,0,1

Injection site reactions Safety and Tolerability Serious Adverse Events Treatment Emergent Adverse Events,0,"September 8, 2022 [Press release] Helixmith Announces Topline Results from Phase 2A Study of Engensis for Treatment of ALS KEY POINTS - Primary endpoint of safety was achieved - A High dose (64 mg/treatment) of Engensis with repeated treatments (3 treatments on 2-month intervals) was safe and well-tolerated September 6, 2022, LA JOLLA, CA - Helixmith announced topline results today from a Phase 2A study in individuals with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)...This Phase 2A was a double-blind placebo controlled multi-center study involving 5 sites (4 in the US and 1 in Korea) and 18 subjects randomized to a 2:1 ratio of Engensis to placebo. In this Phase 2A study, three treatments of Engensis, a plasmid DNA encoding human HGF, or placebo were injected in the upper and lower limbs on months 0, 2 and 4. One treatment consisted of two cycles of injections, on 2-week intervals, of 64 mg of Engensis or placebo in total. Therefore, a total of 192 mg of Engensis was given to each subject over a 4-month period. In addition, there was a follow-up period of 6 months after the first injection on Day 0. The results of the study demonstrated that Engensis was safe and well tolerated at this dosing regimen. There was no difference in the frequency of TEAEs (83% for each group) between the Engensis and the placebo groups. One TEAE, bronchitis, was reported in the Engensis group but was determined to not be related to the study drug. Injection site reactions were reported by 50% of the Engensis group and by 66.7% of the placebo group. Most of the injection site reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within a short time, and none of the participants in the study discontinued due to the number of injections. These data suggest that high dose, repeated treatments of Engensis, were safe and well tolerated, providing a great deal of flexibility in designing dosing schemes for future clinical studies. Given the primary endpoint of this study was to test safety and tolerability, efficacy was measured only as an exploratory parameter. ALSFRS-R scores, muscle functions using handheld dynamometry, and ALSAQ-40 were among the measurements collected. Since the study size was small and 4 subjects dropped out early, we were unable to compare efficacy between the Engensis and placebo groups. An important component of this study was the collection of biopsy samples from the participants’ injections sites. Engensis is an intramuscularly delivered gene therapy. The bulk of the data collected to date, showing effects of HGF expressed from Engensis, has been from animal models. Data collected from clinical trials has been limited thus far. Thanks to our dedicated clinical trial participants, muscle biopsy samples were collected during the course of the trial and will be subjected to histological and molecular biological analyses using RNA-Seq... ...Helixmith will continue the analysis of the Phase 2A data upon the receipt of the full report and plan to present results at a future conference and determine next steps for Engensis in ALS at that time. https://www.helixmith.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=s5_1&wr_id=231; September 5, 2022 [Press release] Helixmith releases topline data on phase 2a trial of Lou Gehrig’s disease drug Helixmith has made public the topline data of the phase 2a clinical trial of Engensis (VM202), its genetic treatment candidate for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)... ...According to the public notice, researchers found treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in 83.3 percent of the subjects. They confirmed bronchial trouble in one participant in the Engensis-administered group, reporting it as a treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE). “However, it did not affect the progress of the subject’s clinical trial,” Helixmith explained. Besides, injection site reactions occurred in 50 percent of the test group and 66.7 percent of the placebo group. However, no participants stopped the clinical trial because of the injection process, the company added. “To make our safety assessment statistically more significant, we need to conduct follow-up studies of more projects,” it said. “We will examine these results more carefully when writing a final report and determine future development directions.”... http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=14534; September 2, 2022 [Press release] [Translated from Korean] Helixsmith, Engensys (VM202) ALS Clinical Phase 2a Topline Data Released Helixsmith announced topline data on the Phase 2a clinical trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease) of 'Engensys (VM202)', a gene therapy product. In this ALS clinical trial, Engensys (VM202) showed excellent safety... ...Helixsmith's Phase 2a ALS clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical study conducted at 5 institutions (4 in the US and 1 in Korea) targeting 18 ALS patients. Engensys (VM202) and placebo were assigned in a 2:1 ratio. In this clinical trial, Engensys (VM202) 64 mg divided into two injections at 2-week intervals was considered as one (treatment) and injected three times at 2-month intervals. This is a total of 192 mg administered in 4 months, which is the highest among Engensys (VM202) doses used so far. Compared to the diabetic neuropathy (DPN) clinical trial, the injection dose is 4 times compared to 1 DPN, the interval is 2 months compared to 3 months of DPN, and the number of injections is 3 times compared to 2 DPN. The main endpoint was safety, which investigated the occurrence of serious adverse events that occurred during the clinical period. Adverse reactions occurred after administration of the test drug in 83.3% of subjects in the Engensys (VM202) group and the placebo group, respectively. Among them, one case of bronchitis in the Engensys (VM202) group was reported as a serious adverse reaction that occurred after administration of the test drug, but there was no correlation with the test drug. Injection site reactions occurred in 50% of subjects in the Engensys (VM202) group and 66.7% in the placebo group, but they were all mild (Grade 1 or Grade 2) and disappeared within a short period of time. No subjects discontinued clinical participation because of the injection procedure. This shows that repeated administration of high-dose Engensys (VM202) is safe and does not cause any specific adverse reactions. It is to provide meaningful information for designing the dose and injection method in the future clinical development of Engensys (VM202). Because the main purpose of this study is to investigate safety, efficacy was set only as an exploratory indicator. Corresponding indicators include change in ALSFRS-R score as an evaluation of body function, Handheld Dynamometry as an evaluation of muscle strength change, ALSAQ-40 as an evaluation of quality of life improvement, and overall evaluation by subjects and researchers. Because the purpose of this clinical trial was to investigate the safety of high-dose repeated administration, it was an exploratory design that did not consider statistical power. Therefore, it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of Engensys (VM202) versus placebo. One of the biggest features of this clinical trial is that, for the first time in the history of Engensys (VM202) research, the muscle at the injection site was collected, and the effects of Engensys (VM202) on human gene expression and biopsy were performed to examine the operation process in the human body. direct analysis. Samples have been taken from some patients who have consented to biopsy, and molecular and cytological analyzes will be performed in the future using several techniques. The results are expected to be important information for understanding the mechanism and principle of action of Engensys (VM202). After receiving the final report from the CRO, Helixsmith plans to conduct a detailed analysis to draw a final conclusion and publish the results in international conferences and academic journals. https://www.helixmith.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=s5_1&wr_id=231","Other Outcome Measures: Changes in muscle function following Engensis injections compared to Placebo [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] Change from Baseline (Day 0) in total mean Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Function Rating (ALSFRS-R) scores, subscores for Fine and Gross Motor Functions and Bulbar Function, and slope of the total score Evaluation of muscle strength changes following Engensis injections compared to Placebo - HHD [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] As assessed bilaterally by Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) in muscles in the upper and lower extremities Evaluation of muscle strength changes following Engensis injections compared to Placebo - ATLIS [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] As assessed bilaterally by the Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) where available Evaluation of Quality of Life improvement following Engensis injections compared to Placebo [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] As assessed using the ALS Assessment Questionnaire with 40 items (ALSAQ-40) Evaluation of Patient and Clinical Reported Outcome improvement following Engensis injections compared to Placebo - PGIC [ Time Frame: Day 84 to Day 180 ] As assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Evaluation of Patient and Clinical Reported Outcome improvement following Engensis injections compared to Placebo - CGIC [ Time Frame: Day 84 to Day 180 ] As assessed using the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) To determine effects of Engensis on respiratory function compared to Placebo - SVC [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] As assessed using Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) To determine effects of Engensis on respiratory function compared to Placebo - Tracheostomy [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] As assessed by time to tracheostomy To determine effects of Engensis on survival compared to Placebo [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] Time to all-cause mortality Comparing gene expression differences in muscle atrophy biomarkers between subjects receiving Engensis and subjects receiving Placebo by using RNA sequencing [ Time Frame: Day 0 to Day 180 ] Using RNA sequencing methods to obtain genome transcription profiles of the group receiving Engensis and the group receiving Placebo, and compare the gene expression differences between these two groups",NCT04632225 REViVALS-1A TrialTroveID-279969 VMALS-002-2,"Primary Outcome Measures : Safety of intramuscular (IM) injections of Engensis in Participants with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) compared to Placebo [ Time Frame: From the Day 0 Visit to the Day 180 Visit ] Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) after injections, injection site reactions, and clinically significant laboratory values for Engensis compared to Placebo",,ALSAQ-40 ALSFRS-R Clinical Global Impression Hand-Held Dynamometry Mortality Patient Global Impression of Change Quality of Life Slow Vital Capacity,279969,Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability Safety/Toxicity > Serious Adverse Events Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Clinical Failure Efficacy > Clinical Response (Patient Reported Outcomes) Heor > Health-Related Quality Of Life Efficacy > Disease Severity,"September 02, 2022 [Translated from Korean] The main endpoint was safety, which investigated the occurrence of serious adverse events that occurred during the clinical period.

Kessler Open label study to assess the safety of VM202 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Results: Seventeen of 18 participants completed the study. All participants tolerated 64?mg of VM202 well with no serious adverse events (SAE) related to the drug. Twelve participants reported 26 mild or moderate injection site reactions. Three participants experienced five SAEs unrelated to VM202. One subject died from respiratory insufficiency secondary to ALS progression. Conclusions: Multiple intramuscular injection of VM202 into the limbs appears safe in ALS subjects. Future trials with retreatment after three months will determine whether VM202 treatment alters the long-term course of ALS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166654 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2016.1259334","Secondary Outcome Measures: The Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) [ Time Frame: Screening, on Day 0 before the treatment (injection), on Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months ] The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Function Rating Scale includes twelve questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patient's level of functional impairment in performing one of twelve common tasks (e.g., climbing stairs). Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0 = worst and 48 = best.

Idrisoglu, Nurkan Polat, Emir Dervis, Fatma M. Dervis, Mustafa B. Idrisoglu The Effect Of Timolol On Sialorrhea In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) Patients(A Pilot Study) Results: All patients had bulbar signs and sialorrhea. Age interval is 35 - 69. The average age is 60. The study includes 7 women and 5 men. One patient was dead without being closely related to the drug an one patient had PEG + tracheostomy. Decrease in the sialorrhea was observed in all patients using the drug. The decrease in sialorrhea was assessed by the reduction in the paper tissue used daily. We believe that botulinum toxin injection, anticholinergic drugs, radiotherapy are useful in the effective treatment of sialorrhoea, which is a common problem in ALS in this study Conclusions: We wanted to demonstrate that this application is safe and effective.The pilot study showed timolol is effective in the burden of drooling treatment and saliva reduction decreased after treatment, but without the risk of decreasing oropharyngeal function.

Single-dose Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of Oral Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Results: Drowsiness, euphoria, orthostasis, sleepiness, vertigo and weakness were significantly more frequent in patients receiving 10mg compared to 5mg THC. A marked interindividual variability was found for the absorption of oral THC (84%) and elimination of THC-COOH (45%). PK data did not support any clinically relevant deviation from linear PK in the investigated range of concentrations. Plasma concentrations of THC-OH were positively correlated with the individual heart rate. An Emax-model was successfully fitted to individual heart rate, with a THC-OH plasma concentration of 3.2·10-4 µmol/L for EC50 and an Emax of 93 bpm for heart rate. Conclusions: The higher 10mg dose of THC was dose-limiting in patients with ALS. High inter individual PK variability requires individual titration of THC for potential therapeutic use in patients with ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594565",,TrialTroveID-167932,,,,167932,Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions Safety/Toxicity > Cardiac Measures/Events Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Efficacy > Symptom Assessment (Patient Reported Outcomes),,,Iv,,1,5,0,1,0,4,11,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Results: Complete data were available from 22 patients. THC was well tolerated. There was no evidence for a treatment effect on cramp intensity, number of cramps, fasciculation intensity or any of the other secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: This interventional study with orally administered THC 5 mg twice daily did not demonstrate subjective improvement of cramp intensity in ALS patients. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498181 http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2010/05/24/jnnp.2009.200642.abstract; December 08, 2009 Presented at 20th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2009, Berlin, Germany Abstractr# P10 Fagagnini S, Baldinger R, Brenneisen R, Hartmann S, Goldman B, Schneider U, Weber M Safety, Dosage, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in ALS-Patients Results: Mean THC-plasma levels rose from 0 to 0.7ng/mL. Mean pulse rose from 81 bpm to 90 bpm with 5mg and from 79 bpm to 90 bpm with 10mg THC, respectively. Only one patient experienced tachycardia of 105 bpm. Three patients had an exacerbation of their (already at baseline elevated) systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Concerning side effects, 5mg were well tolerated by all patients. At 10mg almost all patients had side effects. Sleepiness, euphoria and drowsiness were the most common complaints. Discussion and Conclusions: Single doses of 5mg were well tolerated, but unlike in healthy controls, doses of 10mg were much less well tolerated. This suggests that affinity to Cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) is different in ALS patients. THC is known to have central sympathomimetic properties and at 10mg, but not 5mg, blood pressure has to be controlled carefully in patients with arterial hypertension. The potential use of THC in ALS patients will be discussed. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1681 [Page# 5-6/17]; November 04, 2008 Presented at 19th International Symposium on ALS/MND, November 3-5, 2008, Birmingham, UK Abstract No: C38 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial with THC (Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol) for the Treatment of Cramps in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Results: A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Two patients experienced spontaneous lessening of cramps during the runin period and withdrew from the study, one patient died during the study. Tolerability of the chosen dosage (THC 5 mg bid) was excellent. Only one patient experienced side effects (dizziness). No patient showed a significant change of monitored haematology and blood chemistry values. Three quarters of the patients were able to identify a treatment period with lessening of cramps. Currently statistical analysis is under way. A repeated measure ANOVA is applied with treatment and carry-over as within factors. The severity of cramps at each day will enter as a covariate in the model. Conclusions: For the treatment of cramps in ALS a dosage of THC 5 mg bid is well tolerated and safe. The fact that three quarters of the patients identified a treatment period with lessening of cramps suggests that THC is also effective. This was not caused by central side effects (e.g. euphoria).

The IDMC’s recommendation to conclude the study was not based on safety or efficacy concerns, and this decision does not impact the commercial availability of edaravone oral suspension (Japan product name: RADICUT® Oral Suspension 2.1%). Study MT-1186-A02, which was a postmarketing commitment following the FDA approval of intravenous edaravone, was designed to evaluate the superiority of an investigational once-daily dosing regimen of oral edaravone (105 mg) vs. the approved on/off dosing regimen administered in 28-day cycles, in people with ALS over 48 weeks. A pre-planned futility analysis, conducted after 50% of the planned study population reached 48 weeks, assessed the study’s primary endpoint and the probability of the study results changing if all participants completed the 48-week study period. Through that interim analysis, the IDMC concluded that there is a low statistical probability for the investigational once-daily dosing regimen to show superiority to the current on/off dosing regimen as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) score at study completion; therefore, study discontinuation was recommended by the IDMC. Preliminary findings of the futility analysis suggest that the efficacy of the approved on/off dosing regimen of oral edaravone was consistent with results of the pivotal Phase 3 trial (MCI186-19 or Study 19) that supported the approval.

September 21, 2022 – Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) today announced two presentations on RADICAVA ORS® (edaravone) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be shared at the 2022 American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting, being held in Nashville, Tenn., from September 21-24. “We look forward to discussing our latest research in ALS with the scientific community at this year’s AANEM meeting, including presentations derived from two Phase 3 trials – one completed and one ongoing – evaluating the long-term use of RADICAVA ORS through 48 weeks of treatment,” said Gustavo A. Suarez Zambrano, M.D., Vice President of Medical Affairs at MTPA. “This information provides the ALS community with additional insights into the clinical use of this oral treatment option plus the importance of continued research, and exemplifies our unwavering commitment to advancing therapies for people living with ALS.” RADICAVA ORS was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an oral suspension form of edaravone that offers the same efficacy as RADICAVA® (edaravone) – an FDA-approved intravenous (IV) treatment shown to slow the loss of physical function in ALS.1 In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in RADICAVA-treated patients were contusion (15%), gait disturbance (13%) and headache (10%).1 In an open-label study (MT-1186-A01), fatigue was also observed in 7.6% of patients receiving RADICAVA ORS. RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to edaravone or any of the inactive ingredients.1 To learn more about RADICAVA ORS, visit RADICAVA.com.

Most patients were male (87.5%) and only 2 patients (12.5%) had had bulbar onset. Their mean age at first infusion was 53.50 years (SD 14.87). All but one were also receiving riluzole. Time since diagnosis to Edaravone’s first infusion was 19.8 months (SD 19.8) while that of riluzole was 3.07 (SD 2.8). The first infusion was usually received at a health care facility (75%) to later be followed by domiciliary cycles (87.5%). Half the patients received 4 or more cycles of infusion. Only one needed a port-a-cath for drug administration. One patient suffered from thrombophlebitis while another had lower limb pain during infusion, which was alleviated in the following cycles with pre-treatment with antihistaminics. Two patients stopped treatment due to drug ineffectiveness. Three patients underwent tracheostomy (18.8%), one of which died shortly after and accounts for one of the three deaths (18.8%) in this cohort. Only 7 patients (47%) received the medication through their health insurance. Conclusions: In this group of patients, Edaravone was well tolerated. Access is still limited since less than half of the patients received treatment covered by their health insurance. https://index.mirasmart.com/AAN2020/PDFfiles/AAN2020-001693.html https://n.neurology.org/content/94/15_Supplement/1693",,TrialTroveID-373066,,,,373066,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Of the 12 individuals with both pre and post- edavarone clinical data, 17% were considered responders (n=2), with improved rates of ALSFRS-R change from 2 (pre) to 0.27 (post), and 0.7 (pre) to 0.2 (post) points per month. These individuals were also on riluzole. Fifty-eight percent of individuals demonstrated no benefit from treatment (n=7) and 25% of individuals demonstrated hastening disease progression rates (n=3). Individuals with mild-moderate disease (ALSFRS-R > 30, n=5) did not respond to treatment (pre: 0.806 vs. post: 2 points per month). Discussion and conclusion: Overall, edaravone was not an efficacious treatment in this descriptive analysis. In terms of disease progression and prescription of edavarone treatment, strict criterion were not utilized to identify eligible patients; however, individuals with milder, earlier onset disease did not respond better to treatment.

Background: An intravenous (IV) formulation of edaravone (Radicut/Radicava) has been approved for use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Japan, South Korea, the United States (US), Canada, and Switzerland. As a part of the US postmarketing requirements for IV edaravone, a clinical trial to assess the risk of QT prolongation with edaravone was conducted. Results: Least squares mean values were ddQTcF < or = 0.9 msec without outlier values, and no morphologic changes suggesting repolarization abnormalities. There was one subject with several QTcF values >450 msec in both the placebo and the edaravone 60mg groups, but no subject had QTcF values >480 msec. There were no outliers for HR (110 bpm, or dHR + or - 20 bpm reaching those levels). There were no outliers for PR interval 220 msec, one in all treatments including at baseline and in the placebo treatment, the other at baseline and at one post-dose time point. No subjects had a decrease or an increase in the PR interval of > or = 25% that reached 220 msec, respectively. QRS duration was essentially unchanged from baseline as compared with placebo. The regression analysis revealed that the estimated mean values of ddQTcF at the geometric mean of Cmax for the edaravone doses had CI upper bounds of Conclusions: Edaravone administered in IV doses up to 300mg showed no clinically relevant effects on the ECG. Edaravone was not associated with cardiac repolarization prolongation.

Disease duration was <1 year (37.3% of patients), or 1-2 years (32.1%). Disease severity (Japan ALS severity classification) included grade 2 (42.0% of patients), grade 3 (28.5%), or grade 1 (15.7%). Most ALS cases were sporadic (96.4% of patients). The most common site of symptom onset was the upper limbs (43.5% of patients). ALS diagnosis (El Escorial revised Airlie House criteria) was definite (34.5% of patients), probable (36.1%), probable supported by laboratory data (19.4%), possible (6.4%), or suspected (3.5%).

Regarding the initial symptoms, bulbar symptoms tended to be much more frequent in the edaravone group than in the control group, but without statistically significant difference. After the initial course of treatment of edaravone, nerve excitability testing showed no significant differences between pre- and post-treatment. At three months, the control group showed significantly decreased potassium currents in nerve excitability testing, whereas the significant changes in potassium currents were not observed in the edaravone group. ALSFRS-R scores were similarly decreased over time in the edaravone and control groups, and compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis tended to decrease in each group, but without a statistical significance. Patients who preserved the stability in axonal membrane function tended to show less progression in ALSFRS-R score and CMAP amplitudes. Conclusion: These results suggest that in ALS patients, alternation of nerve excitability was suppressed by edaravone from the viewpoint of axonal function.

Mean duration of disease was 1 year. The stage of the disease 1 and 2 stage. The age interval of the patients ranged from 35 to 77 years. Mean age was 52 years. Two patients died independent of the drug. Two patients underwent PEG and tracheostomy. BIBAP was applied to four patients. Discussion and conclusion: In the patients that took Radicut treatment (in the ratio of 10–15%) for at least three weeks, partial recovery was seen in the first 2 weeks in six patients. However, no effect was found in the continuous usage of the drug and progression was determined in the patients. Although it is a safe drug, we did not see the effects in the treatment of ALS. At the same time, it is an expensive drug. Radicut treatment looks like Thyroid Relapsing hormone treatment (in 1983).

Adverse Events ALSFRS-R Safety and Tolerability,1,"August 17, 2023 [Press release] [Post-hoc analysis] Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America Announces Post-Hoc Analysis Examining Effect of Early Intervention with RADICAVA® (edaravone) on Survival and Disease Progression Milestones in People with ALS Results from this Analysis were Published in Muscle & Nerve JERSEY CITY, N.J. August 17, 2023 – Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) today announced the publication of a post-hoc analysis of the pivotal, Phase 3 study (MCI186-19) reviewing the effect of intravenous (IV) RADICAVA® (edaravone) on survival and additional disease progression milestone events in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Results from the analysis, which were published in Muscle & Nerve, suggest that timely and continued treatment with RADICAVA when initiated first was associated with a lower risk of death, tracheostomy, permanent assisted ventilation (PAV) or hospitalization, compared to people with ALS who received placebo first followed by RADICAVA. “While the ALSFRS-R is considered the gold standard used to assess ALS progression and treatment efficacy, there is value in exploring other outcome measures, including survival-related events,” said Gustavo A. Suarez Zambrano, M.D., Vice President of Medical Affairs at MTPA. “This post-hoc analysis of our Phase 3 MCI186-19 study allows us to grow our understanding of the benefit of starting early and continued treatment with RADICAVA, and is a reflection of our commitment to ensure people with ALS are at the center of everything we do.” The post-hoc analysis assessed the double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week Phase 3 MCI186-19 study of RADICAVA, including an additional 24-week open-label period with all study participants receiving RADICAVA first (edaravone-edaravone [EE]) vs. placebo first (placebo-edaravone [PE]). Results from the survival analysis showed: A 53% relative risk reduction of the cumulative occurrence of milestone events (death, tracheostomy, PAV or hospitalization due to ALS progression) in the EE group vs. PE group, with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.25-0.88, p=0.02). ALS survival composite endpoint analyses (ALS/SURV) suggested a treatment benefit (least squares mean difference) for the EE group vs. the PE group at week 24 (0.15±0.05 [95% CI, 0.06-0.25] p<0.01) and week 48 (0.11±0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.21] p=0.02). There were no deaths during the double-blind period. During the open-label period, there were two deaths in the EE group and four in the PE group. As these results are from a post-hoc analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, this post-hoc analysis relied on data from weeks 24-48 of the MCI186-19 study, which were not placebo controlled and were not adjusted for statistical multiplicity. Results of this analysis have not been replicated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn without additional, appropriately controlled clinical studies. Lastly, the MCI186-19 study was not powered a priori to analyze the novel composite endpoint of death, tracheostomy, PAV, or hospitalization. The understanding of these study limitations is critical to proper application of insights... https://www.mt-pharma-america.com/media/news/press-releases/2023/08/17/mitsubishi-tanabe-pharma-america-announces-post-hoc-analysis-examining-effect-of-early-intervention-with-on-survival-and-disease-progression-milestones-in-people-with-als; July 31, 2023 Muscle Nerve. 2023 Jul 31. First published: 31 July 2023. Benjamin Rix Brooks MD, Erik P. Pioro MD, PhD, Takeshi Sakata MS, Fumihiro Takahashi PhD, Melissa Hagan PhD, MPH, Stephen Apple MD The effects of intervention with intravenous edaravone in Study 19 on hospitalization, tracheostomy, ventilation, and death in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: The risk for death, tracheostomy, PAV, or hospitalization was 53% lower among patients in the edaravone-first vs placebo-first groups (hazard ratio = 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.88], P = .02). The overall effect of IV edaravone on ALS progression could be seen in the significant separation of time-to-event curves for time to death, tracheostomy, PAV, or hospitalization. ALS survival composite endpoint analyses (ALS/SURV) suggested a treatment benefit (least-squares mean difference) for the edaravone-first versus the placebo-first group at week 24 (0.15 ± 0.05 [95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.25], P < .01) and week 48 (0.11 ± 0.05 [95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.21], P = .02). Discussion: These analyses illustrate the value of timely and continued IV edaravone treatment, as earlier initiation was associated with a lower risk of death, tracheostomy, PAV, or hospitalization in patients with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37525592/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27946; August 11, 2022 [Post hoc Analysis] Muscle Nerve. 2022 Aug 11.

Within the 25% slower-decline group, 60% (21/35) had Japanese ALS severity grades 3 or 4 at the start of edaravone treatment. The LASSO model identified serum urate as associated with the percentage change in ALSFRS-R slope. The rate of decrease in urate was smaller in the 25% slower-decline group than in the non-25% slower-decline group during edaravone treatment. Discussion: This post hoc analysis indicated that ALS patients, including those with advanced ALS severity grades, may receive benefit in the group of patients whose urate levels are stable during the course of the edaravone treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36054038/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27699; August 11, 2022 [Pooled Pos Hoc Analysis] Muscle Nerve. 2022 Aug 11. Fumihiro Takahashi , Osamu Kano , Yoshito Nagano, Takatomo Yoneoka, Sally Nelson, Yoshiteru Ushirogawa Associations between the ALSFRS-R score and urate levels during 12 months of edaravone treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Post hoc analysis of ALSFRS-R scores in clinical studies MCI186-16, MCI186-17, and MCI186-19 Results: Compared with the PE group, the EE group showed a slower decline in ALSFRS-R score, regardless of the urate baseline level, and a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup. Smaller changes in ALSFRS-R score and urate were observed in patients diagnosed with ""probable, laboratory-supported ALS."" There was a positive correlation between changes from baseline to cycle 12 in urate levels and ALSFRS-R score. Discussion: Edaravone treatment in ALS patients diagnosed with ""definite ALS"" or ""probable ALS"" showed slowing of disease progression, regardless of baseline urate level. In addition, because edaravone treatment was associated with a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup and urate-level changes were associated with changes in ALSFRS-R score, urate level, and/or change may be one indicator in predicting disease progression after edaravone administration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36053970/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27700; June 14, 2022 [Post-hoc analysis] PLoS One. 2022 Jun 14;17(6):e0258614.

For the FVC24 > or =80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25). Linear regression analysis indicated that, in the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, there was a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph after the start of edaravone treatment. Conclusion: ALS subjects in the Study 19 placebo arm had a slowing in disease progression, even when edaravone was added with an FVC of <80%p prior to starting edaravone. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to validate these post-hoc findings. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35700157/ Full text available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/35700157/ https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258614 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9197041/pdf/pone.0258614.pdf https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258614&type=printable; July 10, 2021 [Sub-group Analysis] Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2021 Jul 10;1-9. Benjamin Rix Brooks, Erik P Pioro, Danielle Beaulieu, Albert A Taylor, Mark Schactman, Mike Keymer, Wendy Agnese, Johnna Perdrizet, Stephen Apple, David L Ennist Evidence for generalizability of edaravone efficacy using a novel machine learning risk-based subgroup analysis tool Results: A broad region of the Study 16 heat map with significant effect sizes was identified, including up to 70% of the trial population. Incorporating participants identified in the cohort enrichment strategy yielded a broad group comprising 76% of the original participants with a statistically significant treatment effect. This broad group spanned the full range of the functional score progression observed in Study 16. Conclusions: This analysis, applying predictions derived using an ML model to a novel methodology for subgroup identification, ascertained a statistically significant edaravone treatment effect in a cohort of participants with broader disease characteristics than the Study 19 inclusion criteria. This novel methodology may assist clinical interpretation of study results and potentially inform efficient future clinical trial design strategies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34251911/ Full text Available https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2021.1927102; March 18, 2021 [Press release] Post-Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 Study Examines Effect of Early Intervention with Edaravone on Survival and Disease Progression Milestone Events in ALS Patients - Data Presented at 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association Virtual Annual Clinical & Scientific Conference JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 18, 2021 – Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc.

There were no deaths during the double-blind period. During the open-label period, there were two deaths in the EE group and four in the PE group.

The hazard ratio for death alone was 0.48 for the EE group vs. the PE group. As these results are from a post-hoc analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution and cannot be considered conclusive evidence of efficacy. “I’m encouraged by the findings of this post-hoc analysis,” said Benjamin Rix Brooks, M.D., an ALS specialist and lead author of the study. “We were able to uncover data that reinforces the need to further our research that can show an important association between edaravone use and the potential decrease in functional decline.” This analysis was funded and conducted by MTPA... https://www.mt-pharma-america.com/2021/03/18/post-hoc-analysis-of-phase-3-study-examines-effect-of-early-intervention-with-edaravone-on-survival-and-disease-progression-milestone-events-in-als-patients/; November 30, 2020 [Press release] Post-Hoc Analysis of ALS Treatment Study Looks at Multiple Staging Systems JERSEY CITY, N.J., November 30, 2020 – Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc.

Ammar Al-Chalabi , Adriano Chiò , Charlotte Merrill , Gerry Oster , Rebecca Bornheimer , Wendy Agnese , Stephen Apple Clinical staging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: analysis of Edaravone Study 19 Results: During double-blind treatment, the percentage of patients who experienced a progression in King's stage was lower for edaravone (42.0%, 95% CI 30.4% to 53.6%) than placebo (55.9%, 95% CI 44.1% to 67.6%). The most pronounced effect was noted among patients who were in stage 1 and was maintained throughout open-label treatment. An analysis of a >or=2-stage progression in MiToS stage showed no difference between treatment arms during double-blind treatment, but during the open-label period, more rapid progression was noted among patients in the placebo-edaravone arm than among those in the edaravone-edaravone arm (log-rank test, p<0.001). Conclusions: The King's and MiToS staging systems provided utility in assessing clinical progression in Edaravone Study 19. These findings may support the use of staging systems as end points in ALS clinical trials and to understand the timing of benefit as measured by these scales. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33109706/ https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2020/10/26/jnnp-2020-323271.long; March 30, 2020 [Press Release, Post-hoc analysis] Radicava Effective in Slowing Progression Across Year of Use, Trial Data Show Radicava (edaravone), an approved treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), can be taken for up to one year without losing its effectiveness, and benefits patients who delay its start — say, after six months of placebo in a clinical trial, a post hoc analysis of that Phase 3 study suggests. These findings were in “Long-term edaravone efficacy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Post-hoc analyses of Study 19 (MCI186-19),” a study published in the journal Muscle Nerve... ...The treatment was approved in the U.S. in 2017 based on findings from Study 19 (NCT01492686), a double-blind Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan that assessed the safety and efficacy of Radicava in people with ALS. Its 137 participants were randomly given either Radicava or a placebo, both via intravenous (IV, into-the-vein) infusions, for 24 weeks. Results showed that those on Radicava experienced a significantly slower decline (by 33%) in their ability to perform everyday activities, compared to those on placebo. Physical abilities were assessed using the ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), which measures the ability to perform such daily functions such as speech, swallowing, and dressing. Patients on placebo lost an average of 7.5 ALSFRS-R points over six months, while those on Radicava lost 5 points during the same period, a difference in decline of 2.5 ALSFRS-R points. After six months, patients had the opportunity to enter an open-label extension part of the study, where all would be treated with Radicava for an additional 24 weeks (about six more months) to explore its long-term safety and efficacy. In total, 123 patients enrolled here, 65 previously on Radicava and 58 from the placebo group. Extension study findings suggested that those staying with Radicava continued to experience slower disease progression, while those previously on placebo started to benefit from the treatment. The lack of a placebo group throughout the entire study’s 48 weeks — serving as a comparative control group — limited the conclusions that could be drawn. This led researchers at MTPA to conduct a post hoc analysis, meaning an analysis done after a study has finished, to better understand Radicava’s long-term efficacy in ALS. Using data from the double-blind first part of Study 19, and assuming that ALSFRS-R declined in a linear manner over time, researchers estimated likely progression in patients on placebo and on Radicava for the first 24 weeks. They then used that estimate to predict progression within each group — with no change in treatment status — over the next six months. Finally, they compared this projected progression with the actual rate of progression among patients using Radicava for the entire 48 weeks, and for those who switched to Radicava from placebo for weeks 24 to 48. The analysis helped them to compare projected disease progression without Radicava for 48 weeks with actual progression with Radicava’s use for 48 weeks (about 1 year), and against actual progression in those with six months of placebo followed by 24 weeks of Radicava. Had patients remained on placebo for 48 weeks, their projected decline would reach 13 ALSFRS-R points, the analysis showed. This decline was significantly greater than the actual decline seen in Radicava-treated patients for 48 weeks, who experienced an 8-point reduction. (The analysis’ projected decline over about one year of Radicava’s use was 8.6 points.) This point gap amounted to a 38% difference in disease progression among those treated continuously with Radicava, and those who would have remained on placebo for 48 weeks (the projected group). The projected decline in a 48-week placebo group was also greater than the actual decline experienced by those who switched to Radicava for a final 24 weeks. Their ALSFRS-R scores were 10.9 points lower than at the study’s start. The rate of progression was also similar between the continuous Radicava and placebo-Radicava switch groups, “supporting treatment benefit of edaravone in ALS patients who begin receiving treatment later in their disease course,” the researchers wrote. Among study limitations noted was the assumption that ALSFRS-R scores decline in a linear manner, which may not be true in early and late disease stages. This should be addressed in future studies of Radicava’s long-term use, the team recommended... https://alsnewstoday.com/2020/03/30/radicava-effective-slowing-als-progression-across-1-year-use-patients-trial-data/; March 24, 2020 Presented at the 2020 MDA Clinical & Scientific Conference, March 22-25, 2020, Orlando, FL Poster number: 53 Gary Pattee, MD, Gustavo Suarez Zambrano, Jeffrey Zhang, Sally Nelson, Stephen Apple, MD POST HOC ANALYSIS OF EDARAVONE STUDY 19: EFFICACY IN BULBAR ONSET ALS PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT REDUCED PULMONARY FUNCTION Results: Following treatment, patients in both the bulbar and limb-onset groups experienced a reduction in ALSFRS-R score loss vs placebo patients through week 48. After starting edaravone, former placebo patients with either bulbar or limb-onset demonstrated a reduction in ALSFRS-R score loss from baseline to week 48, and a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph. Analysis of bulbar-onset patients with either FVC >or=80% or <80% experienced a reduction in ALSFRS-R score loss vs placebo patients. In this report, no unexpected safety signals were seen, nor any inconsistencies with those of Study 19. Conclusions: This analysis seems to indicate that ALS patients with bulbar-onset disease receive a significant benefit from initiating edaravone treatment regardless of whether they have baseline FVC >or=80% or <80%. The limitations inherent with post hoc analyses should be considered when interpreting these results. https://mdaconference.org/node/942; November 8, 2019 [Post-Hoc Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 20, Issue supplement 1, November 2019 Presented at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 4-6, 2019, Perth, Australia Online published date: November 8, 2019 Abstract No.: CLT-39 Joseph Palumbo,, Stephen Apple, Wendy Agnese, Manabu Hirai, Takatomo Yoneoka, Fumihiro Takahashi, Koji Takei, Mai Endo Retaining Physical Function in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Edaravone: Post Hoc Analysis of Pivotal Study MCI186-19. Results: Post hoc analyses appeared to reveal a consistent effect on retaining physical function favoring edaravone. Among the ALSFRS-R items, the largest effects were seen with swallowing, eating motion, walking, and climbing stairs. By day 180 (ie, approximately the end of the double-blind period), the cumulative probability from 4 or 3 to 2 or less in placebo compared to edaravone was at least 2-fold in the swallowing, eating motion, and walking items of the scale and there was a 7.4-fold difference for climbing stairs. The differences by the end of the analysis period (day 300) ranged from 1.4-fold for eating motion to 2.2-fold for climbing stairs. The difference in median survival time was at least double for eating motion and climbing stairs. Consistent with these findings, analysis of ALSAQ-40 subdomains appeared to indicate that the greatest benefits were found in domains for activities of daily living/independence and eating and drinking. Conclusions: Edaravone was associated with marked reductions in the proportion of patients who experienced a 3-to-2 transition in ALSFRS-R item scores for swallowing, eating motion, walking, and climbing stairs. Analogous findings were obtained from subdomain analysis of the ALSAQ-40. The results show that edaravone may have a clinically meaningful effect in retaining function in patients with ALS. The limitations inherent with post hoc analyses should be considered when interpreting these results.

The projected ALSFRS-R decline for placebo from baseline through week 48 was greater than for 48-week edaravone (P?<?.0001). For patients switching from placebo to edaravone, ALSFRS-R slope approached that of continued edaravone for 48?weeks. ALSFRS-R decline did not differ between actual and projected edaravone through week 48. Conclusions Compared with placebo, these analyses suggest that edaravone is beneficial in ALS patients even after 6 mo of receiving placebo, and efficacy is maintained for up to 1?year.

During Period II: 18 of 58 patients initially randomized to placebo discontinued; 11 due to events attributed to worsening of ALS and seven at patients’ request; 12 of 65 patients initially randomized to edaravone discontinued, six due to events attributed to worsening of ALS and six at patients’ request. At the end of Period II, discontinuation rates were 38% in those randomized to placebo at study start vs 20% in those randomized to edaravone. At the end of Period II, there was 48% relative risk reduction in death and pre-specified disease progression events in the group randomized to edaravone compared to placebo. Rates of severe and serious adverse events, as well as discontinuations due to adverse events were lower in the edaravone group compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: In this study, serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events were paradoxically lower in the edaravone group versus the placebo group. This is because these events were mainly ascribed to disease worsening. Patients were almost twice as likely to complete the study if they initially were assigned to edaravone. Similarly, there was an over 40% risk reduction in death and disease progression events in patients started on edaravone.

[Epub ahead of print] The Writing Group on behalf of the show Edaravone (MCI-186) ALS 19 Study Group Safety and efficacy of edaravone in well defined patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Results Between Nov 28, 2011, and Sept 3, 2014, we screened 213 patients, and enrolled 192 as potential participants. Of these, 137 patients completed the observation period: 69 were randomly assigned to receive edaravone, and 68 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. 68 patients taking edaravone and 66 taking placebo were included in the primary efficacy analysis. For the primary outcome, the change in ALSFRS-R score was -5·01 (SE 0·64) in the edavarone group and -7·50 (0·66) in the placebo group. The least-squares mean difference between groups was 2·49 (SE 0·76, 95% CI 0·99–3·98; p=0·0013) in favour of edaravone. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 58 (84%) patients receiving edaravone and 57 (84%) patients receiving placebo. 11 (16%) patients taking edaravone and 16 (24%) taking placebo had serious adverse events, and one (1%) patient receiving edaravone and four (6%) patients receiving placebo had adverse events (one dysphagia in edaravone group and one dyspnoea, two respiratory disorder, and one rash in the placebo group) that led to withdrawal. Conclusions Edaravone showed efficacy in a small subset of people with ALS who met criteria identified in post-hoc analysis of a previous phase 3 study, showing a significantly smaller decline of ALSFRS-R score compared with placebo. There is no indication that edaravone might be effective in a wider population of patients with ALS who do not meet the criteria. http://thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30115-1/abstract Also available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522181; November 8, 2016 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, 2016; 17(Suppl.

Results: The results show that the mean age of the onset of the disease was 58.58 +or -11.55 years old, and the duration of the disease was 3.46+or -2.41 years. ALSFRSR was 32.57+or -9.53 points, %FVC was 74.6+or -33.5, 26 subjects were able to walk independently, 15 subjects used NIPPV and 2 subjects had tracheotomy in this clinic. Among 22 subjects who survived 3 years or more, 9 subjects (4 UEP, 1 LEP, and 4 BP) received edaravone and in the non-edaravone group 13 subjects did not (4 UEP, 6LEP, and 3 BP). Morbidity period from onset was 4.4+or -1.2 in the edaravone group and 5.9+or -2.5 years in the non-edaravone group. ALSFRS-R was 31.3+or -6.7 in the edaravone group and 25.3+or -9.1 in the non-edaravone group. %FVC was in the edaravone group 79.2 and 56.6 in the non-edaravone group. The average period of receiving edaravone was 1.85+or -1.87 year. Discussion: Although this is not a randomized study, edaravone might inhibit the progression of the disease in patients who survived three years or more. We will also report the effect of rehabilitation for ALS patients who received edaravone. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925",,TrialTroveID-121739,,,,121739,,,,Iii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Within the 25% slower-decline group, 60% (21/35) had Japanese ALS severity grades 3 or 4 at the start of edaravone treatment. The LASSO model identified serum urate as associated with the percentage change in ALSFRS-R slope. The rate of decrease in urate was smaller in the 25% slower-decline group than in the non-25% slower-decline group during edaravone treatment. Discussion: This post hoc analysis indicated that ALS patients, including those with advanced ALS severity grades, may receive benefit in the group of patients whose urate levels are stable during the course of the edaravone treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36054038/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27699; August 11, 2022 [Pooled Pos Hoc Analysis] Muscle Nerve. 2022 Aug 11.

Smaller changes in ALSFRS-R score and urate were observed in patients diagnosed with ""probable, laboratory-supported ALS."" There was a positive correlation between changes from baseline to cycle 12 in urate levels and ALSFRS-R score. Discussion: Edaravone treatment in ALS patients diagnosed with ""definite ALS"" or ""probable ALS"" showed slowing of disease progression, regardless of baseline urate level. In addition, because edaravone treatment was associated with a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup and urate-level changes were associated with changes in ALSFRS-R score, urate level, and/or change may be one indicator in predicting disease progression after edaravone administration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36053970/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27700; September 5, 2017 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2017 Oct;18(sup1):20-31. doi: 10.1080/21678421.2017.1362000. WRITING GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE EDARAVONE (MCI-186) ALS 17 STUDY GROUP. Exploratory double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled extension study of edaravone (MCI-186) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results Analysis populations were the full analysis set (FAS) and the efficacy-expected subpopulation (EESP) defined by post-hoc analysis of the first phase III study. The least-squares mean and standard error of the intergroup difference (E-E vs. E-P) of change in the ALSFRS-R score from Cycles 7-12 was 1.16?+ or - 0.93 (p?=?0.2176) in the FAS, and 1.85?+ or - 1.14 (p?=?0.1127) in the EESP. The ALSFRS-R score changed almost linearly in the E-E group throughout Cycles 1-15 (60 weeks). Conclusion: The incidence of serious adverse events associated with ALS progression was higher in E-E than in E-P. Edaravone might have potential efficacy for up to 15 cycles when used to treat patients in the EESP with careful safety monitoring. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28872918 (Below is the full text link) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2017.1362000; March 4, 2016 Presented at the 68th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 15-21, 2016, Vancouver, Canada Abstract #: P3.192 Takeshi Sakata,Joseph M.

However, analysis of a subgroup with greater baseline functionality (percentage forced vital capacity=80% and with=2 points for all item scores in the ALSFRS-R at baseline), the difference versus placebo increased to 1.85±1.14 (P=0.113). In a further post hoc refinement, requiring definite/probable ALS, and study entry=2 years since first symptom, the difference was further increased to 2.79±1.51 (P=0.072). Serious AEs occurred in 44.3% of the P-E group, in 28.9% of the E-P group, and in 52.1% of the E-E group (P=0.034 E-P versus EE). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 4.4% in the E-P group, 10.4% in the E-E group, and 10.2% in the P-E group. There were no serious ADRs in any of the groups.

In addition, because edaravone treatment was associated with a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup and urate-level changes were associated with changes in ALSFRS-R score, urate level, and/or change may be one indicator in predicting disease progression after edaravone administration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36053970/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27700; October 6, 2014 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2014 Oct 6:1-8.

Confirmatory double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of efficacy and safety of edaravone (MCI-186) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Results: Patients were treated with placebo (n = 104) and edaravone (n = 102). Changes in ALSFRS-R during the 24-week treatment were -6.35 +or- 0.84 in the placebo group (n = 99) and -5.70 +or- 0.85 in the edaravone group (n = 100), with a difference of 0.65 +or- 0.78 (p = 0.411). Adverse events amounted to 88.5% (92/104) in the placebo group and 89.2% (91/102) in the edaravone group. Conclusions: In conclusion, the reduction of ALSFRS-R was smaller in the edaravone group than in the placebo group, but efficacy of edaravone for treatment of ALS was not demonstrated. Levels and frequencies of reported adverse events were similar in the two groups. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286015 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/21678421.2014.959024 Full text available on: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/21678421.2014.959024","Secondary Outcome Measures: Death or a Specified State of Disease Progression [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Any of ""death, disability of independent ambulation, loss of upper arm function, tracheotomy, use of respirator, and use of tube feeding"" was defined as an event.

In almost all patients, CSF 3NT, a marker for oxidative stress, was markedly reduced to almost undetectable levels at the end of the six-month treatment period. Conclusions: Data from the present study suggest that edaravone is safe and may delay the progression of functional motor disturbances by reducing oxidative stress in ALS patients. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17127563 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17482960600881870?journalCode=aml; November 30, 2006 Presented at the 17th International Symposium on ALS/MND, 30 Nov - 2 Dec 2006, Yokohama, Japan Theme 5 - Therapeutic strategies Poster#P78 Repeated Administration Of Edaravone, A Free Radical Scavenger, For Patients With ALS Results: Efficacy was evaluated in the 60 mg group of patients. Six months following administration, the ALSFRS-R was inhibited by 2.4 + or - 3.5 points (paired t-test, p=0.035) compared to the six-month prior level. The change in %FVC at six months following administration was -4.47 + or - 12.30%. In almost all patients, CSF 3NT was markedly reduced to almost undetectable levels at the end of the six-month treatment period. Stratified analysis showed that in the group pf patients with equal to or greater than 41 points ALSFRS-R at the commencement of the study (n=4), %FVC was increased by 7.23 + or -14.77, while in patients with less than 41 points ALSFRS-R (n=8), %FVC was reduced by 10.31 + or - 5.19. Conclusion: In the previous placebo-controlled short term study, efficacy of edaravone was also demonstrated in %FVC and in the change of ALSFRS-R score in patients with equal to or greater than 41 points ALSFRS-R. Combined with the present six months open study, edaravone might inhibit the progression of ALS in the early stage.

Nishimura Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of an investigational oral formulation of edaravone (MT-1186) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Results: ...In patients with ALS (Study J04), the investigational, oral edaravone was well absorbed after the oral administration and showed triphasic plasma concentration-time profiles of edaravone after reaching Cmax, as in the healthy subjects. The single dose of investigational, oral edaravone was well tolerated, with 1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) reported in 1 patient. The TEAE was mild in severity and was judged not to be reasonably related to the investigational product by the investigator. Similar results were obtained in the study with ALS patients who had PEG tubes (Study J05). Discussion: These studies provide clinical evidence for the bioequivalence and tolerability of the investigational, oral edaravone and will help support the development of MT1186 for patients with ALS.

Geometric mean ratios and 90%CIs of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point and to infinity for unchanged edaravone satisfied bioequivalence limits. The geometric mean ratio and its lower limit of 90%CI of Cmax of the 105-mg oral suspension compared with 60-mg intravenous formulations for unchanged edaravone fell within bioequivalence limits. Both formulations showed triphasic plasma concentration-time profiles of unchanged edaravone after reaching Cmax . Plasma concentrations of edaravone inactive metabolites after oral administration were higher than with intravenous administration. Edaravone in both routes underwent urinary excretion, mainly as the glucuronide conjugate and, to a lesser extent, as the sulfate conjugate. Urinary excretion of unchanged edaravone was low, and urinary relative composition ratios of unchanged edaravone and metabolites were similar for both formulations. These findings showed equivalent exposure of the 105-mg oral suspension of edaravone to the 60-mg intravenous formulation, supporting further investigation of the oral suspension for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33955162 Full text available at: https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpdd.952 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8518908/","Secondary Outcome Measures : Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) [ Time Frame: The date of dosing is defined as Day 1.

A subject's score will be calculated by comparing each subject to every other subject within each treatment group in the study, resulting in a score of +1 if the outcome was better than the subject being compared, -1 if worse, and 0 if the same. The subject's score will then be calculated by summing up their comparison to all of the other subjects within each treatment group in the study as CAFS score. Patients' summary scores are ranked; a higher score indicates a better performance. The score range is from 1 to N, where N is the total sample size.

Findings: After reaching maximum plasma concentration, the mean plasma concentration-time of unchanged edaravone showed a triphasic elimination. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles of the metabolites were higher than those of unchanged edaravone. The mean urinary excretion ratios were higher for the glucuronide conjugate than for either unchanged edaravone or the sulfate conjugate. In patients administered edaravone orally, a single adverse event occurred (blood urine present), which was mild and improved without medical intervention. No adverse drug reactions or serious adverse events were reported. In patients administered edaravone via PEG tube, 5 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 3 patients; none were related to the study drug. No adverse drug reactions were reported. Implications: In patients with ALS, a single dose of edaravone oral suspension was well absorbed and mainly eliminated in urine as the glucuronide conjugate. No safety concerns emerged.

September 21, 2022 – Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) today announced two presentations on RADICAVA ORS® (edaravone) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be shared at the 2022 American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting, being held in Nashville, Tenn., from September 21-24. “We look forward to discussing our latest research in ALS with the scientific community at this year’s AANEM meeting, including presentations derived from two Phase 3 trials – one completed and one ongoing – evaluating the long-term use of RADICAVA ORS through 48 weeks of treatment,” said Gustavo A. Suarez Zambrano, M.D., Vice President of Medical Affairs at MTPA. “This information provides the ALS community with additional insights into the clinical use of this oral treatment option plus the importance of continued research, and exemplifies our unwavering commitment to advancing therapies for people living with ALS.” RADICAVA ORS was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an oral suspension form of edaravone that offers the same efficacy as RADICAVA® (edaravone) – an FDA-approved intravenous (IV) treatment shown to slow the loss of physical function in ALS.1 In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in RADICAVA-treated patients were contusion (15%), gait disturbance (13%) and headache (10%).1 In an open-label study (MT-1186-A01), fatigue was also observed in 7.6% of patients receiving RADICAVA ORS. RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to edaravone or any of the inactive ingredients.1 To learn more about RADICAVA ORS, visit RADICAVA.com. Poster Presentation Details: 48-week safety results from the global Phase 3 multi-center, open-label clinical trial (MT-1186-A01) of RADICAVA ORS in patients with ALS will be presented, as well as the study design from the ongoing, Phase 3b multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group study (MT-1186-A02) comparing two dosing regimens for RADICAVA ORS to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety over 48 weeks.

Details about the findings will be presented at the European Network to Cure ALS (ENCALS) Meeting 2022, being held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from June 1-3. RADICAVA ORS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 12, 2022, as an oral treatment for ALS.The FDA approval of RADICAVA ORS was supported by several studies, including 24-week results from the global Phase 3 trial (MT-1186-A01) demonstrating the safety and tolerability profile of the treatment in 185 ALS patients (aged >or= 18 years to 75 years) across 50 sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan [2]... ...According to the 48-week results presented at ENCALS, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by >or= 10% of patients were fall (22.2%), muscular weakness (21.1%), constipation (17.8%), dyspnea (10.8%), dysphagia (10.3%) and back pain (10.3%). No serious TEAEs considered to be treatment-related by investigators were reported. Sixteen subjects (8.6%) discontinued the study due to TEAEs. The most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation were respiratory failure, muscular weakness and pneumonia, consistent with the disease state. There were 12 deaths during the 48-week study period, and none of the deaths were related to the study drug (respiratory failure, worsening of ALS, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, lung disorder, diabetic ketoacidosis, feeding disorder and suicide). ""I'm encouraged by the findings from the Phase 3 trial, which provide important information on the safety and tolerability of this new formulation of edaravone in patients with ALS,"" said Gary L. Pattee, M.D., a neurologist and ALS specialist based in Lincoln, Neb. ""These data reinforce the potential significance of RADICAVA ORS and its important role in the treatment of this devastating disease."" In addition, the loss of physical function was evaluated as an Exploratory Endpoint and measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), a validated rating instrument for monitoring the progression of disease in patients with ALS. The changes from baseline to all post-baseline visits until Week 48 in ALSFRS-R score were estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis from 139 subjects who completed the study. At the beginning of the study, patients had an average ALSFRS-R score of 40 (SD 4.5).

The ADORE clinical trial is a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 100 mg edaravone (FAB122) once daily as oral formulation in ALS patients, during a 48-week period. Study participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral edaravone or placebo while continuing to receive their existing standard of care treatment for ALS. It was conducted with the support of TRICALS, the largest European research initiative focused on finding a cure for ALS. Data from ADORE indicates that product did not show significant benefit over placebo in patients with ALS in slowing the disease progression as measured by change from baseline in the ALSFRS-R score after 48 weeks of daily dosing with the oral edaravone formulation. No improvement over placebo on long-term survival was observed as measured by CAFS at 48 weeks and 72 weeks for a subgroup of patients.

GCoco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased fat mass percentage, subscapular skinfolds, and abdominal skinfolds. GAx + coco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased abdominal skinfolds. Therefore, our results suggest that the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with NR and PTER and the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with coconut oil (ketogenic diet) are the two nutritional interventions that have reported the greatest benefits, at anthropometric level. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37810917/ Full text https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1232184/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10556480/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10556480/pdf/fnut-10-1232184.pdf; January 22, 2019 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2019 Feb;20(1-2):115-122.

One patient discontinued it after three months of full dose therapy because the worsening of the disease with severe muscle atrophy and weakness. One patient discontinued the treatment after 2 weeks because failure of efficacy. Two patients manifested minor side effects (dizziness, vertigo and constipation) but continued the treatment. One patient withdrew eperisone after 5 days of full dose (300mg/day) because of vertigo, but he well tolerated a lower dose (200mg/day) and continued this dose. A patient withdrew the treatment after two weeks since manifested urinary incontinence. All adverse events were reversible after drug discontinuation. Conclusion: Further evaluation of eperisone in phase II study is planned to adequately ascertain the tolerability and the efficacy in ALS patients with spasticity. http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/07/28/50/ALSConsortiumYoungInvestigatorMeeting.pdf (Page 20/56)",,TrialTroveID-159636,,,,159636,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,,,Ii,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

The SICI-1 increased by 53% (mean ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12-2.09; P = .009) in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group. The SICI-1 did not change in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.52; P = .31). The resting motor threshold increased in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 4.61; 95% CI, 0.21-9.01; P = .04) but not in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, -2.64 to 6.54; P = .40). Ezogabine caused a dose-dependent decrease in excitability by several other metrics, including strength-duration time constant in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: Ezogabine decreased cortical and spinal motor neuron excitability in participants with ALS, suggesting that such neurophysiological metrics may be used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in multisite clinical trials. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33226425/ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2773459","Secondary Outcome Measures : Change in resting motor evoked potential (MEP) threshold (prespecified secondary outcome of primary importance) [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by TMS Change in MEP amplitude [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by TMS Change in MEP latency [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by TMS Change in duration of cortical silent period [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by TMS Change in intracortical facilitation [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by TMS Change in electrotonus [ Time Frame: Screening, Baseline, Week 6, Week 8 ] Assessed by threshold tracking axonal nerve conduction studies (TTNCS).

During the six-month follow-up, no severe treatment-related adverse events were observed, indicating short-term treatment safety. Compared with 18 matched controls, the declines of ALFRS-R during the first three months in fasudil group had a trend slowing down without significant difference (p=0.263). In the second three months, the change of ALSFRS-R was significantly greater in fasudil group than control (p=0.008). During the follow-up period, the survival time of two groups seems no difference. Conclusion The first pilot study in patients with ALS showed that the fasudil treatment is safe, but didn't appear to effectively modulate disease progression in six-month observation period.

Stem cell transplantation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Methodological approach, safety, and feasibility. Results: The survival at one year was 90% after transplantation with a mean long term survival rate of 40.17 months from diagnosis. The most common adverse events were in grades I-II and involved transient skin pain (19.5% of patients) attributed to the insertion of the Mahurkar catheter into the subclavian vein, minor scalp pain (15.9%), and headache (12.2%) from the surgical procedure. Several patients (1.5%-4.5%) reported diverse grade I adverse events. There were two deaths, one considered to be associated with the procedure (1.5%) and the other associated with the disease. Conclusion: Autologous stem cell transplantation into the frontal motor cortex is safe and tolerated well by patients. Further controlled studies are required to define the efficacy of this procedure. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23356668 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cog/ct/2012/00000021/00000009/art00007?token=00521ba5aab54298f03573d257025706a235b2f7a736a425574797c4e75477e4324576b6427388e126 Full text available at http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/cog/09636897/v21n9/s7.html?expires=1464812086&id=87105663&titleid=5476&accname=Guest+User&checksum=4B552C248691E1F87229F308F74828FE",,TrialTroveID-163081,,,,163081,Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,"February 13, 2012 Autologous stem cell transplantation into the frontal motor cortex is safe and tolerated well by patients http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22329998",Ii,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",3,8,1,0,0,0,12,SAFETY,1,0,0,1

Overall results demonstrated both strong trends and statistically significant differences relative to control despite the small cohort size. Treatment with FLX-787 increased the number of cramp-free days and reduced the frequency of cramping, as well as self-reported NRS spasticity and pain scores. Improvements were observed in both patient and clinician global impression of change. Conclusions: Initial results from this study suggest that FLX-787 mediated activation of TRPA1/TRPV1 ion channels may be an effective approach to decrease muscle cramp frequency, cramp-associated pain and selfreported stiffness which improve patient and clinical global impression.

Across studies, muscle cramping was observed throughout the night with slightly higher frequency during the latter portion of the night (6–8h). Cramp inhibition by TRPV1 and TRPA1 co-activation was most prominent during the first four hours after dosing with noted decreases in cramp frequency during this time. The cramp survey results agreed with these findings with 56% of respondents experiencing relief in the first 4 hours after dosing. Conclusion: The results suggest that Chemical Neuro Stimulation is effective at increasing the number of cramp free nights which may lead to improved sleep and decreased pain. Chemical Neuro Stimulation may be a useful strategy to improve sleep quality in individuals suffering from cramps and spasticity associated with neurological disease Page No. A434, A435 http://www.sleepmeeting.org/docs/default-source/attendee-documents/abstractbook2017.pdf?sfvrsn=2; April 15, 2016 Presented at the 68th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 15-21, 2016, Vancouver, Canada Abstract #: 013 Jennifer Marie Cermak, Laura Rosen, Brooke Hegarty, Bruce Bean, Rod MacKinnon, Christoph Westphal, Thomas Wessel Orally-Administered TRPV1 and TRPA1 Activators Reduce Night Leg Cramps in a Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Human Trial Results: Statistically significant effects were demonstrated on key endpoints: cramp frequency (p<0.05); cramp-free days (p<0.01), the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (p<0.01); specific sleep disturbance (p<0.05) and pain measures (p<0.05). The product appeared to be safe, well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. The magnitude of cramp reduction appears to be similar to published “Class 1 level” quinine efficacy studies (quinine was banned by the FDA for leg cramps due to safety issues). Finally, a subset of subjects had a pronounced clinical benefit. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that TRP activation can reduce NLC. This supports the novel concept of Chemical Neuro Stimulation, a process whereby small molecules activate TRP ion channels topically, leading to sensory stimulation that in turn reduces hyperexcitability in motor neurons at multiple levels in the spinal cord. The human efficacy signals generated in this study hold promise for a new approach in NLC and cramps in neurological disorders. Based upon these results, we plan to initiate studies with a single molecule TRP activator in NLC, MS and ALS.

Synthetic TRP Activators Demonstrate Efficacy in Preventing Human Muscle Cramping: Potential New Drug Treatment for Muscle Cramps and Spasticity. Results: FLX-787 & FLX-788 prevented or reduced cramp intensity in clinical studies (statistically significant, several fold reduction). Compared to natural TRP activators the anti-cramping effect of FLX-787 and FLX-788 was significantly enhanced.

Results: The basal and the methionine-loading serum HC concentration was not different with those of age, sex-matched normal controls. The study failed to show benefit of HC-lowering therapy for the primary end points (slope of AALSRS). The serum HC level of the treatment group did not decreased, compared with the basal HC level. Conclusion: Interestingly, the disease progression (AALSRS, FALSRS) was highly correlated with the serum HC level. Even though the HC-lowering multi-vitamins therapy failed to show the benefit in ALS patients, this study showed that the ALS patient whose serum HC level was high aggravated more rapidly than the low HC ALS patient. The negative results might be caused by not to medicate such a sufficient dose of the vitamins to lower the serum HC level. In this perspective, HC might be precipitating factors in ALS. http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=9126&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=18&XNMASKEN_ID=900 http://www.neuro.or.kr/workshop/abstract/admin/schedule/view_abstract.php?abstract_year=2004_7&number=23O10152",,TrialTroveID-080425,Primary end point: Slope of AALSRS.,,,80425,,,,Ii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

New York/London, 26 May 2021 - Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (""Tiziana"" or the ""Company""), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, today provided an update on further analysis of lymphocyte subsets from blood samples from a Phase 1 study with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy volunteers. Results exhibiting statistically significant immunomodulatory effects on CD8 cytotoxic T - lymphocytes and other inflammatory biomarkers were observed. This Phase 1 trial, conducted at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, was a single - site, double - blind, placebo - controlled, dose - ranging study with nasally administered Foralumab at 10, 50 and 250 mcg per day, consecutively for 5 days in healthy volunteers. The treatment was well - tolerated at all doses and there were no apparent symptoms of severe toxicity. Importantly, the treatment showed significant positive effects at 50 mcg/day dose (compared to other dose and placebo groups) on T-cell subsets and inflammatory biomarkers. These data support other clinical and pre - clinical studies showing that this route of administration is capable of inducing site - targeted immunomodulation and anti - inflammatory effects. Furthermore these pharmacodynamic data point to a clinical dose range that Tiziana intends to test in further clinical development among MS patients. Highlights of clinical and immunologic data - Nasally administered Foralumab was well tolerated and there were no apparent symptoms of severe toxicity or cytokine release syndrome. - Systemic levels of Foralumab were below the lower quantitation limit of 8 ng/mL suggesting that nasally administered Foralumab appears to exert its effects via nasal epithelium utilizing local and lymphatic immune systems directly. - Most prominent effects among cytotoxic T - cell subsets were observed in the 50mcg group compared to 10mcg, 250mcg and placebo groups. - The observed effects in the 50mcg dose group were the following: a.Statistically significant reductions from baseline in CD8_Tem cytotoxic T - cell subset through 14 days and CD8_TEMRA, CD8_GranzymeB, CD8_Perforin subsets through 21 days b.Statistically significant increase from baseline in CD8_naive subset through day 21 c.Statistically significant stimulation in production of anti - inflammatory cytokine IL - 10 along with suppressed production of pro - inflammatory cytokine IFN - gamma, suggested a positive trend for immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effect. These observed clinical responses on biomarkers, indicative of immunomodulation and anti - inflammatory, are consistent with the positive clinical data observed with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil....""Nasal administration of Foralumab is a unique approach to treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive MS , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study demonstrates for the first - time that nasally administered Foralumab, at the identified optimal dose of 50 mcg/day, induces immunomodulatory effects capable of providing clinical benefit to treated subjects. These data along with results from our recently completed trial in COVID-19 patients in Brazil suggest a dose - range of 50 mcg - 150mcg could be used for future clinical development of nasally administered Foralumab... https://ir.tizianalifesciences.com//news-releases/news-release-details/tiziana-life-sci-plc-significant-immunomodulation-effects",,TrialTroveID-330861,,,,330861,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,"September 10, 2019 Tiziana Life Sciences plc...is pleased to report Phase 1 clinical data demonstrating that nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), was well-tolerated at all doses.

There were no treatment related changes in blood or CSF PGRN levels, which remained stable in each individual over 28 days. Systemic and CSF FRM-0334 levels were not proportional to the administered dose and did not reach exposures which would be necessary based on preclinical experimentation to increase GRN mRNA & PGRN. No changes in exploratory outcomes were observed. There was considerable heterogeneity in clinical and imaging findings between participants at baseline. Conclusion: FRM-0334 was safe and well tolerated in GRN mutation carriers but had no effect at doses tested on PGRN levels. Systemic and CSF FRM-0334 levels were lower than expected suggesting insufficient FRM-0334 exposure. Therefore the hypothesis that HDAC inhibition can increase PGRN expression in humans was not fully tested. https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&project=AAIC19&id=32300","Secondary Outcome Measures: Assess the pharmacodynamic effects of FRM-0334 on the change from baseline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of PGRN after 28 days [ Time Frame: Baseline and Day 28 ] Change in CSF progranulin concentration from baseline Characterize the plasma concentrations of FRM-0334 and metabolites following once daily dosing for 28 days [ Time Frame: Day 1 to Day 28 or Early Termination ] Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, t1/2, ?z, AUC(0-t), CL/F, Cav in plasma Characterize the CSF concentrations of FRM-0334 and metabolites following once daily dosing for 28 days [ Time Frame: Day 1 to Day 28 or Early Termination ] Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, t1/2, AUC0-t, CL/F, Cav in CSF Characterize the intra- and inter-individual variability in plasma and CSF concentrations of PGRN Secondary objectives were to assess FRM-0334 effects on CSF PGRN, as well as FRM-0334 pharmacokinetics.

During the 3 months after the treatment period, the decline of the ALSFRS-R was significantly better than that in the 3 months prior to G-CSF administration (20.6154+/-1.1209 vs 23.2308+/-2.8330, P50.012), the change of the ALSFRS-R in 3 to 6 months after treatment was significantly worse than that in the 3 months after G-CSF administration (21.6+/-1.0750 vs 20.6154+/-1.1209, P50.009) too. Secondary analysis by repeated measures analysis of variance concludes similarly, test of within-subjects effect gives a P value of 0.023. Thus, treatment with G-CSF appeared to reduce the rate of decline of ALSFRS-R. The level of CMAP is an objective index avoiding placebo effect. Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates the decline of CMAP amplitude during 3 months after rhG-CSF administration was significantly better than that in natural course in 3 months prior to administration (20.6914+/-1.1762 vs 0.0591+/-0.6041, P50.023), the change of the CMAP amplitude in 3 to 6 months after treatment was worse than that in the 3 months after administration (20.3426+/-1.4997 vs 0.0591+/-0.6041, P50.093), but not significant. Conclusions: We found that the decrease of the ALSFRS-R during the 0–3 months after treatment period was significantly better than that in the 23–0 months prior to the start of treatment. This result suggests that G-CSF may delay the progression of functional disturbances in ALS patients. The decline of ALSFRS-R in 3–6 months was significantly worse than that in 0–3 months, but better than that in 23–0 months of natural course. This phenomenon indicated the possibility of a residual effect in 3–6 months after treatment. Our trial showed the change of average CMAP amplitude during 0–3 month after treatment period was significantly better than that in the 23–0 month prior to the start of treatment, the mean value even become positive. The decline of average CMAP amplitude in 3–6 months after treatment was negative and worse than that in 0–3 months, but better than that in 23– 0 months. It is necessary to confirm the efficacy of rhGCSF in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded design. We have registered (NCT00397423), and are conducting the trial at present. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925",The secondary outcome measure was average CMAP amplitude.,TrialTroveID-121983,"The primary outcome measure was the change of ALSFRS-R during three periods – 3 months prior to the treatment, 3 months after treatment, and 3 to 6 months after treatment.",,,121983,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,,,Ii,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients who received G-CSF and 18 who received placebo were evaluated. G-CSF was effective in mobilizing CD34+ to blood. The outcome measures used showed no statistically significant benefit, although there was a trend of slowing disease progression following two G-CSF treatments, as shown by lower slopes of ALSFRS-R and QoL in the first six treatment months. Conclusions: The treatment had no major side-effects. G-CSF administration in ALS patients caused successful mobilization of autologous bone marrow cells, but was not effective in slowing down disease deterioration. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449238?dopt=Abstract http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/17482960902933809; March 31, 2009 Presented at the 35th Annual Meeting of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, March 29 - April 1, 2009, Göteborg, Sweden Abstract no. 743 B. Nefussy, I. Artamonov, V. Deutsch, E. Naparstek, V. Drory, A. Nagler Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a double blind randomised study. Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled (study arm – 19, control arm – 20). G-CSF was effective in mobilizing CD34+ cells to blood. The results showed a trend of slowing disease progression following two cycles of G-CSF treatment in the G-CSF treated group in the first six treatment months. Shown by lower slopes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale score (monthly decrease of 0.77 vs 1.08 points in the G-CSF vs controls, respectively, which means about 30% reduction) and the McGill QoL [decline by only 0.5 point /6 months vs a decline of 3 fold higher (1.4 points) in the controls], respectively. The treatment had no major side effects. Conclusion: G-CSF administration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients caused successful mobilization of autologous stem progenitor cells, within the normal range. A trend of slowing down disease deterioration at six months was observed, although it did not reach statistical significance due to the small number of patients enrolled and the high drop-out rate. No major side effects were observed. A further study with a higher G-CSF dose, possibly a different dose schedule, a combination with an intervention with changes permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, or with one of the novel CXCR4 based emerging cell mobilizing drugs, in a larger number of patients is warranted. http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=80218&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=91&XNMASKEN_ID=900; November 03, 2008 Presented at 19th International Symposium on ALS/MND, November 3-5 2008, Birmingham, UK Abstract# P03 Nefussy B, Artamonov I, Nagler A, Deutsch V, Naparstek E1, Drory V Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Administration In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Phase I/Iia, Doubleblind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Results: 39 patients (25 males) were enrolled, of them 19 received the active drug. 17 patients completed the one-year trial.

G-CSF prevents the progression of structural disintegration of white matter tracts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a pilot trial. Results: Treatment was well-tolerated. No significant differences were found between groups in clinical tests and brain volumetry from baseline to day 100. However, DTI analysis revealed significant reductions of fractional anisotropy (FA) encompassing diffuse areas of the brain when patients were compared to controls. On longitudinal analysis, the placebo group showed significant greater and more widespread decline in FA than the ALS patients treated with G-CSF. Conclusions: Subcutaneous G-CSF treatment in ALS patients appears as feasible approach. Although exploratory analysis of clinical data showed no significant effect, DTI measurements suggest that the widespread and progressive microstructural neural damage in ALS can be modulated by G-CSF treatment. These findings may carry significant implications for further clinical trials on ALS using growth factors. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21423758 Full text available http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056779/?tool=pubmed",Secondary Outcome Measures Response time in a word learning model.

GDC-0134 (up to 1200 mg daily) was well tolerated in the SAD and MAD stages, with no serious adverse events (SAEs). In the OLE, three study drug-related SAEs occurred: thrombocytopenia, dysesthesia (both Grade 3), and optic ischemic neuropathy (Grade 4); Grade =2 sensory neurological AEs led to dose reductions/discontinuations. GDC-0134 exposure was dose-proportional (median half-life = 84 h). Patients showed GDC-0134 exposure-dependent plasma NFL elevations; DLK cKO mice also exhibited plasma NFL compared to wild-type littermates. Conclusion: This trial characterized GDC-0134 safety and PK, but no adequately tolerated dose was identified. NFL elevations in GDC-0134-treated patients and DLK cKO mice raised questions about interpretation of biomarkers affected by both disease and on-target drug effects. The safety profile of GDC-0134 was considered unacceptable and led to discontinuation of further drug development for ALS.

Jason Lickliter, Shuang Wang, Wenxin Zhang, Huaqiang Zhu, Jing Wang, Congqiao Zhao, Haige Shen, Yu Wang A phase I randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics of RIPK1 inhibitor GFH312 in healthy subjects At least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 42.1% (part I) and 63.2% (part II) of subjects receiving GFH312, compared with 42.9% and 40.0% of subjects receiving placebo, respectively. The most common TEAE was headache (21.1%). Two treatment-related TEAEs were reported in part I and four in part II. No serious TEAEs were reported. Systemic absorption was rapid; exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration and maximum plasma concentration) increased with dose level. The GFH312 CSF concentration post 100 mg single dose was approximately fourfold higher than the half maximal inhibitory concentration of human monocyte-derived macrophages necroptosis with expected central nervous system penetration. Subjects receiving GFH312 had decreased phospho-RIPK1 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells postdose. In conclusion, GFH312 was well-tolerated and demonstrated RIPK1 inhibition in healthy subjects. Ongoing studies will inform the use of GFH312 in potential indications. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37345561/ Full text available at: https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cts.13580 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10499419/; March 10, 2023 [Press release] GenFleet Therapeutics to Present Phase I Data for GFH312 at 2023 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics Meeting GenFleet Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on cutting-edge therapies in oncology and immunology, today announced the results from phase I study of GFH312 (RIPK1 inhibitor) monotherapy will be presented as a poster at the 2023 ASCPT Meeting in Atlanta on March 22nd. GFH312 is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects in single or multiple doses with favorable PK /PD profile to support further clinical development. As of July 2022, no grade 3 or above adverse effects were reported among all subjects. A rapid inhibition of RIPK1 phosphorylation in PBMCs was observed as soon as 2 hours post dosing in all dose groups and a sustained inhibition was achieved post multiple dosages. The data of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from subjects receiving 120 mg daily administration suggest that GFH312 has exposure in the CNS and may potentially be useful for treating neurological indications.

Linear pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior was observed over the dose range from 45 mg to 360 mg. Limited accumulation was observed after multiple doses with accumulation ratio (RACmax and RAAUC) <2-fold across all dose cohorts GFH312 is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects at either single or multiple doses, the PK characteristics support further clinical development of GFH312. http://www.genfleet.com/en/press_release-56; February 16, 2023 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS, Volume 113, Issue S1, Pages: S1-S115, March 2023 ASCPT 2023 First published date: February 16, 2023 Abstract No. EP-032 Huaqiang Zhu, MD, J. Lickliter, J. Wang, S. Wang, H. Zhu, H. Shen, Y. Wang A FIRST-IN-HUMAN PHASE I STUDY OF THE GFH312 A RIPK1 INHIBITOR, EVALUATING SAFETY/TOLERABILITY AND PHARMACOKINETICS IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS. Results: 76 subjects completed the study and GFH312 was well-tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, with headache and procedural pain reported most frequently. No deaths, no grade 3 or above AEs or serious TEAEs were reported. Three subjects reported grade 2 AEs in MAD, including vertigo positional, back pain and blood creatinine increase. with the latter considered related to GFH312 and recovered to normal at the end of treatment visit, also other subjects of the same group showed lesser degrees of reversible creatinine elevation. GFH312 was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration 2-8 h post-dose and was eliminated with a half-life of 6.3-23.3 h after a single oral dose. Accumulation following multiple dosing and food effect on absorption were limited. Cerebrospinal ?uid (CSF) mean concentrations were 26.6-58.2 ng/mL at 4 h after a single dose. A rapid inhibition of RIPK1 phosphorylation in PBMCs was observed post-dosing in all dose groups. Conclusion: GFH312 was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects with favorable PK and sustained target RIPK1 inhibition. The results support further evaluation of GFH312 in clinical studies. https://ascpt2023.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=T0ZZRlFOUkgxODIxOQ&PosterID=553353&rnd=0.301948&mode=posterInfo; August 18, 2022 [Press release] GenFleet Receives FDA Approval for Phase II Study of RIPK1 Inhibitor ...

Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between groups, including site of disease onset, riluzole use and ALSFRS-R scores. At study conclusion, five patients in each active treatment group had at least one injection site reaction (p50.01). A systemic postinjection reaction consisting of palpitations, flushing, and thoracic tightness occurred in five of the treated patients (p50.15). There were no other differences in safety measures between groups, or in treated patients overall compared to controls. There were six serious adverse events (two in the daily, one in the bi-weekly and three in the control groups, respectively), including four deaths; none was considered related to GA. There were no dropouts or dose reductions for reasons other than death. Analysis of lymphoproliferative responses to GA in in vitro assays showed significant effects by treatment group (p50.006), visit (p50.018) and in interaction between dose and visit (p50.012). Conclusions: We report the first randomized controlled trials of vaccination therapy in ALS. GA was safe and well tolerated in two different doses, and with riluzole. There were no significant differences in any safety measures other than injection reactions. The robust T-cell mediated immune response provides evidence of enhanced protective immunity, and will be used to select dosing frequency in a trial of efficacy.

After 52 weeks of follow-up, the slope of the ALSFRSR score was comparable in the both groups (placebo, -1.00+/-0.06/month; GA, -1.05+ or -0.06/month; p=0.48). The secondary endpoint was non-significant with 159 patients (87.4%) alive in the placebo group and 162 patients (88.1%) in the GA group (log rank, p=0.75). The most common events were the injection site reactions (76.1% in the GA group, 14.8% in the placebo group), comparable to the known profile of 20 mg GA.

Results: The study was terminated by Biogen in December, 2019, prior to completion of the planned enrollment of 32 participants, after negative Phase 22 progressive supranuclear palsy trial results were obtained. Adverse events were more frequent in participants randomized to BIIB092 (83%) compared to participants randomized to placebo (28%), though no AEs were thought to be attributable to study drug.

Conclusion: 6 months of BIIB092 treatment was safe and well tolerated in a small number of individuals with different tauopathy syndromes. If CSF unbound N-terminal tau concentrations after BIIB092 treatment differ substantially in different tauopathies, this might indicate different affinity of this antibody for different disease associated tau species.

Golden; Lara Katzin; Clifton Gooch. A Pilot Trial of High Frequency High Dose Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Results: In this on going study, we have treated 3 patients for up to 6 months. GCSF level was maximal at day 3 and normalized by day 12 after start of treatment. The number of CD34+ cell peaked at 5 days and returned to baseline 9 days after treatment. BDNF level significant increased 2 days after GCSF treatment. The rate of progression was not altered by GCSF treatment. Conclusions: GCSF rapidly and repetitively mobilized BMPC, but duration of effect was brief. This change is well correlated to plasma GCSF level. BDNF level was up-regulated. No effect on clinical measures was observed. This pilot study is ongoing, and additional data will clarify these findings. However, these preliminary results suggest a single or repeated courses of GCSF at three month intervals (as used in previous studies) may not be adequate to maintain physiological effects. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN14L1_P4.078 http://www.neurology.org/content/82/10_Supplement/P4.078",,TrialTroveID-205673,,,,205673,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Respiratory Function,,,Ii,"Completed, Outcome unknown",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,EFFICACY,0,0,0,1

ALS patients showed a diminished disease progression based on analysis of functional endpoints. The study was recently published in the journal Brain. In this Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial, researchers investigated the use of guanabenz, an FDA-approved drug for hypertension and shown to act on a critical step in the ISR pathway, in combination with riluzole. Specifically, it is believed to inhibit eIF2a-phosphatase, and thereby prolong the protective effect of the Integrated Stress Response. The results demonstrate the potential of an ISR modulator to slow the progression of ALS, in particular in bulbar onset, when compared with patients that took only riluzole (placebo group) or with an historical cohort... “Our findings indicate further clinical development with a molecule targeting the ISR without the alpha-2 adrenergic related side-effect profile of guanabenz is warranted,"" stated Giuseppe Lauria, M.D., Head of the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, IRCCS and lead author of the study. ""We look forward to participating at a trial center in InFlectis' planned Phase 2 study of IFB-088.""... Study Design and Results Patients were divided in four groups.

ALSFRS-R Change in FVC,0,"November 5, 2020 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 21, Issue supplement 2, November 2020 Presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2020, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 5, 2020 Abstract No.: CLT-21 Dr Mónica Povedano, Dr Andrés Paipa, Dr Miquel Barceló, Mr Michael Woodward, Dr Sandra Ortega, Dr Raul Domínguez, Dr Raquel Horrillo, Dr Montserrat Costa, Dr Antonio Páez Plasma exchange with albumin replacement slowed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression. A pilot study Results: Thirteen adults with ALS were enrolled and evaluated. Median (IQR) overall ALSFRS-R score at baseline was 42.0 (37.0, 44.0). ALSFRS-R scores declined throughout the study, although the median decline was less than expected in pre-treated patients. Seven patients had a slower decline than expected at the end of treatment and five patients had a slower decline at the end of study. Six patients remained in the same baseline slope progression category while four improved their slope category at the end of treatment. Median (IQR) of FVC and predicted FVC percentage at baseline were 3.9 (3.0, 4.9) L and 87.0% (76.0, 96.0), respectively. Median FVC decreased significantly during the study. The study treatment was well-tolerated. Conclusion: PE with albumin replacement was safe and welltolerated in ALS patients. Although functional impairment progressed, most patients showed a slower than expected rate of decline at the end of treatment. In terms of ALSFRS-R slope progression, most patients had an unaltered (54.5%) or reduced slope progression (36.4%).

Interim results: A total of 13 subjects were enrolled, 8 of which completed the treatment phase as per protocol. Age ranged from 33-66 and there were 10 males and 3 females, 7 presenting bulbar onset and 6 spinal onset. Overall mean ALSFRS-R at baseline was 40.2 declined to 32.9 at week 25 (decline rate: -1.22/month). However, analysis of per-protocol population revealed a decline rate of -0.67/month. Baseline FVC was 85.8% declining to 66.8% at week 25 (decline rate: -3.2%). Significant changes from baseline were not detected with the ALS-CBS scale (16.5 + or - 3.1 at baseline and 17.1 + or - 3.0 at week 25) and ALSAQ40 index (30.2 + or - 15.0 at baseline and 43.7 + or - 19.4 at week 25). No serious adverse events related to the investigational product or procedure were registered. Discussion and conclusions: PE is safe and well tolerated in ALS patients. Average ALSFRS-R and FVC declined as expected but there was a subgroup of subjects that showed a slower progression. Larger clinical trials should be considered to further test efficacy.

Merkies IqYmune is an effective maintenance treatment for multifocalmotor neuropathy: A randomised, double-blind, multi-centercross-over non-inferiority study vs Kiovig—The LIME Study ...The primary endpoint was the difference between IqYmune® and Kiovig® in mean assessments of modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) 10 sum score (strength of five upper‐limb and five lower‐limb muscle groups, on both sides, giving a score from 0 to 100) during the evaluation period (non‐inferiority margin of Δ = 2). A linear mixed model analysis demonstrated the non‐inferiority of IqYmune relative to Kiovig, independently of the covariates (value at baseline, treatment period and treatment sequence). The estimated ‘IqYmune ‐ Kiovig’ difference was ‐0.01, with a 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.48. The number of adverse reactions (ARs) and the percentage of patients affected were similar for the two products: 39 ARs in 10 patients with IqYmune® versus 32 ARs in 11 patients with Kiovig®. No thromboembolic events nor hemolysis nor renal impairment were observed. In this first clinical trial comparing two IVIg brands for maintenance treatment of MMN, efficacy and tolerability of both brands were similar. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jns.12291 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329063372_IqYmuneR_is_an_effective_maintenance_treatment_for_multifocal_motor_neuropathy_a_randomised_double-blind_multicenter_cross-over_non-inferiority_study_versus_KiovigR_-_The_LIME_Study; June 3, 2017 EU Clinical Trials Register Results Summary EudraCT number: 2012-001995-12 Trial protocol: IT GB ES FR Global completion date: 01 Jul 2016 Results information Results version number: v1(current) This version publication date: 03 Jun 2017 First version publication date:03 Jun 2017 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2012-001995-12/results; Clinical Study Report Synopsis Title: A European, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, cross-over, efficacy and safety study of a new 10% ready-to-use liquid human intravenous immunoglobulin (I10E) versus Kiovig in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy Results: Efficacy results: Primary efficacy endpoint Non-inferiority of the MMRC 10 sum score for I10E as compared to Kiovig was demonstrated. The comparison test was based on a linear mixed model that estimated the effect of the product, period, and sequence. The estimates of the effect of each of these 3 factors were adjusted based on for the two other factors as well as on baseline MMRC 10 sum score. The table below presents the main results of the primary analysis using the linear mixed model analyzing the “modified Intent-To-Treat as treated” population The estimated difference between I10E and Kiovig with regard to the MMRC 10 sum score was -0.01 with a 95% CI of [-0.51, 0.48]. This 95% CI was entirely above the non-inferiority margin - = -2. The associated p-value of the non-inferiority test was p<0.0001. Secondary efficacy endpoints Using the same linear mixed model as for the primary endpoint, this study showed no statistically significant difference between I10E and Kiovig in the mean assessments of all the secondary endpoints based on continuous variables: • MMRC new 10 sum score • Rasch-built MMRC 10 sum score • MMRC 14 sum score • Total INCAT disability score • Upper limbs INCAT disability sub-score • Grip strength in the most affected hand The results of CGI global improvement and efficacy index measured at the end of each period were also comparable between both products. The analysis of the change of dose or frequency of IVIg due to a worsening of the neurological status appears to be inadequate and no conclusion can be drawn with regard to this endpoint. One subject decided to withdraw from the study while being treated with I10E. The reason for this discontinuation was the subject’s dissatisfaction with IMP but the reason for this dissatisfaction was not clearly identified. No safety concerns with I10E were observed. The Sponsor believes that the subject found the IMP was not efficient while the various efficacy scales showed contradictory results. Conclusion: The study showed the non-inferiority of I10E compared to Kiovig, with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean assessment of the MMRC 10 sum score during the Evaluation Period. The study showed no difference between I10E and Kiovig with any of the secondary efficacy endpoints. Safety results with both products were consistent with the known safety profile of IVIg. In summary, the efficacy of I10E was not inferior to that of Kiovig in the maintenance treatment of subjects with MMN and no safety concerns were observed.

Patients treated with PenGH progressed with 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-3.3) ALSFRS-R points per month and PenGH treatment did not halt disease progression (p = 0.002). No significant differences were found between PenGH or placebo (mean difference 0.5, 95% CI -1.01 to infinity, p = 0.28). Although PenGH was well-tolerated, 6 patients (38%, 3 in each arm) had thrombotic complications due to the intravenous administration method. Conclusions: Treatment with PenGH does not halt disease or reverse progression in patients with ALS and showed no statistical difference with those who received placebo.

Patients in the high dose Ritonavir arm compared to placebo had a 5 fold decline in FVC (pv0.0001), a 19 fold decline in weight (pv0.0001), a 3 fold decline in MMT (pv0.0001), and the decline in ALSFRS was unchanged. The other arms of the study did not show significant differences in the above measures compared to placebo at the time of the interim safety analysis. Based on these findings the high dose Ritonavir arm was eliminated from the study. Final results will be presented at the meeting, as the last patient will finish the study in July, 2007. Discussion and conclusions: Performing a safety study testing 2 potential efficacious drugs for ALS with a placebo control allowed us to identify a toxic drug early in the study and to eliminate the high-dose arm based on an interim safety analysis. This may serve as a model for other phase 1 studies to help avoid drugs proceeding to phase II trials that are toxic to ALS patients. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=916 (This URL has expired) http://www.als-mda.org/research/news/071218als_toronto_conf.html (This URL has expired) http://www.mndassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MND%202007%20(1965)_2305.pdf?f82b9d",,TrialTroveID-122009,"ALSFRS-R was the primary outcome measure.

One subject withdrew following the first infusion after experiencing hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and 2 subjects withdrew after meeting a stopping rule related to hearing loss. Overall, HPβCD had an acceptable safety profile. The observed pharmacokinetic profile of HPβCD was similar following the first and seventh infusions, with a plasma half-life of 2 h, a maximum concentration reached at 6 to 8 h, and no evidence of accumulation. Serum biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism showed reduced synthesis and increased degradation. Compared to Baseline, filipin staining of liver tissue showed significant reductions of trapped unesterified cholesterol at both dose levels at Week 14. Plasma PPCS levels were also reduced. HPβCD was detected at low concentrations in the CSF (maximum, 33 μM) at both dose levels and persisted longer in CSF than in plasma. Total Tau levels in CSF decreased in most subjects. Serum levels of 24(S)-HC, a cholesterol metabolite from the CNS that is exported across the blood-brain barrier and into the circulation, decreased after both the first and seventh doses. Hence, pharmacodynamic assessments in both peripheral and CNS-related tissue show target engagement. While not the aim of the study, subjects reported favorable impacts on their quality of life. Conclusions: The plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HPβCD administered at two intravenous dose levels to subjects with NPC1 were comparable to those observed in preclinical models. HPβCD cleared cholesterol from the liver and improved peripheral biomarkers of cholesterol homeostasis. At low CSF concentrations, HPβCD appeared to be pharmacologically active in the CNS based on the increased efflux of 24(S)-HC and reduction in CSF total Tau, a biomarker of CNS neurodegeneration. These data support the initiation of longer-term clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous HPβCD in subjects with NPC1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36279795/ Full text available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109671922200419X?via%3Dihub","Change in ataxia as measured by Spinocerebellar ataxia functional index [Time Frame: Change from Baseline as measured every 12 weeks through week 96 and end of OLE week 192] SCAFI Change in adaptive behavior as measured by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II [Time Frame: Change from Baseline as measured every 12 weeks through week 96 and end of OLE week 192] Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II Change in Swallow function evaluated by videofluoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscopy and measured by Penetration Aspiration Scale [Time Frame: Change from Baseline measured at Interim Analysis Week 48] PAS Change in Swallow function evaluated by videofluoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscopy and measured by Penetration Aspiration Scale [Time Frame: Change from Baseline measured at End of Study Week 96] PAS Change in speaking ability compared to Baseline as measured by voice recordings collected in SpeechVitals mobile device application [Time Frame: Baseline and every two weeks through week 192] Measurement of speech features including articulatory precision, speaking and pause rates Change in speaking ability compared to Pre-Infusion as measured by voice recordings collected in SpeechVitals mobile device application [Time Frame: Every two weeks through week 192] Measurement of speech features including articulatory precision, speaking and pause rates within 24 hours post-infusion Change in Scores of Clinical Global Impression of Severity and of Change compared to Baseline [Time Frame: Baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 100, 120, 144, 168, 192] Clinical Global Impression of Severity and of Change Change in Scores of Caregiver Global Impression of Severity and of Change scales [Time Frame: Baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 100, 120, 144, 168, 192] Caregiver Global Impression of Severity and of Change Caregiver Global Impression of Change at 24 hours post infusion [Time Frame: Baseline and every 2 weeks through week 192] Caregiver Global Impression of Change at 24 hours post infusion Change from Baseline in Respiratory function measured by Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second [Time Frame: Baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 100, 192] FEV1 Change from Baseline in Liver function as measured by liver enzyme assessments [Time Frame: Baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 100, 120, 144, 168, 192] Liver function measured by liver enzyme assessments including alanine and aspartate aminotransferases Safety assessments to include incidence of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events [Time Frame: Regular assessments per protocol through week 192] Incidence of AEs, SAEs, incidence of abnormal laboratory test results, abnormal ECGs, abnormal physical exams, abnormal vital signs and abnormal hearing assessments assessments",CTD-TCNPC-301 EudraCT Number: 2020-003136-25 NCT04860960 TransportNPC TrialTroveID-402637,"Change from Baseline in 4-Domain NPC Severity Score (US only) [Time Frame: Interim Analysis at Week 48] Ambulation, Fine Motor, Speech, Swallow Change from Baseline in 4-Domain NPC Severity Score (US only) [Time Frame: End of Study at Week 96] Ambulation, Fine Motor, Speech, Swallow Change from Baseline in 5-Domain NPC Severity Score (ex-US) [Time Frame: Interim Analysis at Week 48] Ambulation, Fine Motor, Speech, Swallow, Cognition Change from Baseline in 5-Domain NPC Severity Score (ex-US) [Time Frame: End of Study at Week 96] Ambulation, Fine Motor, Speech, Swallow, Cognition",,Ability to swallow Adverse Events Aspartate aminotransferase level Clinical Global Impression Liver function Percent change in FEV1 Safety and Tolerability Serious Adverse Events Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Vital signs,402637,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions Efficacy > Laboratory Measurements Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Laboratory Measurements Efficacy > Respiratory Function Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability Safety/Toxicity > Serious Adverse Events Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Serious Adverse Events,,Iii,,4,15,2,2,0,0,23,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Three patients (all in the 1500 mg/kg group) discontinued the study because of either physician decision/site Principal Investigator (PI) discretion, withdrawal by subject/patient/parent/guardian, or other non-safety reasons. In 5 patients who underwent serial lumbar punctures, HP-β-CD was detected in the CSF. Of the 9 patients who completed the study, 8 (88.9%) improved in at least two domains of the 17-Domain Niemann-Pick disease Type C-Clinical Severity Scale (17D-NPC-CSS), and 6 of these patients improved in at least one domain viewed by patients and their caregivers to be key to quality of life, namely, speech, swallow, fine and gross motor skills, and cognition. Of the 9 patients who completed the study, 7 were viewed by their treating physicians as having improved to some degree at the end of the study, and 2 remained stable; both outcomes are highly relevant in a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Some patients and families reported improvement in quality of life.All three doses of HP-β-CD were well tolerated overall, with most treatment-emergent adverse events transient, mild-to-moderate in nature, and considered by the site PIs to be not related to study drug. Interpretation: This 48-week trial is the longest to date to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy across multiple clinical endpoints of IV administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ (HP-β-CD) in NPC1 patients. In pediatric and adult patients with NPC, Trappsol® Cyclo™ IV improved clinical signs and symptoms and was generally well tolerated. The findings presented here demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile and support the global pivotal trial now underway to evaluate the long-term treatment benefits and the potential of Trappsol® Cyclo™ as a disease-modifying treatment in this patient population. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37670901/ [Full text available at:] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214426923000344?via%3Dihub https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10475848/; July 23, 2022 EU Clinical Trials Register Results Summary EudraCT number: 2015-005761-23 Trial protocol: GB SE IT Global completion date: 03 Mar 2021 Results information Results version number: v1(current) This version publication date: 23 Jul 2022 First version publication date:23 Jul 2022 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2015-005761-23/results","Markers of cholesterol metabolism [ Time Frame: Screening,Days1,2,3,5,8,Weeks 2,4,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48 and follow-up ] CSF levels of HP-??-CD [ Time Frame: Pre then 4,8,and 12h after the start of the initial infusion ] Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE ( version 4.03) [ Time Frame: Screening,Days1,2,3,4,6,8,Week 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48 and follow-up ] Abdominal ultrasound [ Time Frame: Baseline 12,24,36 and 48 weeks ] The proportion of patients with a reduction from baseline in the NIH NPC severity scale [ Time Frame: Baseline and 48weeks ] Top evaluate the impact of treatment on ataxia [ Time Frame: Screening, baseline and weeks 12,18,36 and 48 ] To evaluate the effect of treatment on fine motor skills [ Time Frame: Screening, baseline and weeks 12,18,36 and 48 ] To evaluate the effect of treatment on saccadic eye movements [ Time Frame: Screening, baseline and weeks 12,18,36 and 48 ] To evaluate cognitive impairment [ Time Frame: Screening, baseline and weeks 12,18,36 and 48 ]",CTD-TCNP-201 CTD-TCNPC-201 EudraCT Number:2015-005761-23 MOH_2017-09-17_000540 NCT02912793 TrialTroveID-287116,"To evaluate the plasma the Maximum Concentration (C max) of 3 doses of Trappsol by measurement of plasma levels [ Time Frame: 0,2,4,6,& 8 hours (h) after the start of the IV infusion of Trappsol and 0.5,1,2,4,8 & 12 h after the end of the infusion ] To evaluate the Time to Maximum Concentration ( Tmax) of 3 doses of Trappsol by measurement of plasma levels [ Time Frame: 0,2,4,6,& 8h after the start of IV infusion of Trappsol and 0.5,1,2,4,6 &12h after the end of infusion ] To evaluate the Volume of Distribution of Trappsol by measurement of plasma levels [ Time Frame: ),2,4,6 & 8 h after the start of the IV infusion of Trappsol and 0.5,1,2,4,8,&12 h after the end of the infusion ] To evaluate the elimination half-life of Trappsol by measurement of plasma levels [ Time Frame: 0,2,3,6 & 8h after the start of IV infusion of Trappsol and 0.5,1,2,4,8 &12h after the end of infusion ]",Number of subjects in period 1 Trappsol® Cyclo™ IV 1500 mg/kg Started:5 Completed:2 Not completed:3 Consent withdrawn by subject:1 Physician decision:1 Unable to travel due to Covid restrictions:1 Trappsol® Cyclo™ IV 2000 mg/kg Started:4 Completed:4 Not completed:0 Consent withdrawn by subject:- Physician decision:- Unable to travel due to Covid restrictions:- Trappsol® Cyclo™ IV 2500 mg/kg Started:3 Completed:3 Not completed:0 Consent withdrawn by subject:- Physician decision:- Unable to travel due to Covid restrictions:- https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2015-005761-23/results,Cognitive function test Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Serum lipids Treatment Emergent Adverse Events,287116,Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics > Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions Safety/Toxicity > Laboratory Measurements Safety/Toxicity > Adverse Drug Reactions,"In pediatric and adult patients with NPC, Trappsol® Cyclo™ IV improved clinical signs and symptoms and was generally well tolerated.

The average annualized change in Full Scale IQ was negative: B = - 1.28, standard error (SE) = 0.70, t(34.2) = - 1.83, p = 0.076. The Vineland-II Adaptive Behavior Composite standard score decreased by 1.76 points per year [SE = 0.67, t(59.1) = - 2.62, p = 0.011], but annualized slopes for each of the domain age equivalents were positive: Communication [B = 0.71, SE = 3.12, t(60.7) = 0.23, p = 0.82], Socialization [B = 2.99, SE = 2.92, t(60.4) = 1.03, p = 0.30], Daily Living Skills [B = 2.76, SE = 2.76, t(60.3) = 1.18, p = 0.24], and Motor Skills [B = 1.42, SE = 0.94, t(50.5) = 1.51, p = 0.14], indicating not worsening but slower-than-average acquisition of skills.

During the first year, two patients had treatment interrupted for one dose, based on grade 1 ototoxicity. All 14 patients were assessed at 12 months. Between 12 and 18 months, one participant had treatment interrupted at 17 months due to hepatocellular carcinoma, one patient had dose interruption for 2 doses based on caregiver hardship and one patient had treatment interrupted for 1 dose for mastoiditis. 11 patients were assessed at 18 months. Between Dec 11, 2013, and June 25, 2014, three participants were assessed for eligibility and enrolled at RUMC, and were assigned to receive intrathecal HPβCD at a starting dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks (two patients), or 400 mg every two weeks (one patient). There were no dropouts in this group and all 3 patients were assessed at 18 months. Biomarker studies were consistent with improved neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis and decreased neuronal pathology. Post-drug plasma 24(S)-HC area under the curve (AUC8-72) values, an indicator of neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis, were significantly higher than post-saline plasma 24(S)-HC AUC8-72 after doses of 900 mg (p=0·0063) and 1200 mg (p=0·0037). CSF 24(S)-HC concentrations in three participants given either 600 or 900 mg of HPβCD were increased about two fold (p=0·0032) after drug administration. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Mid-frequency to high-frequency hearing loss, an expected adverse event, was documented in all participants. When managed with hearing aids, this did not have an appreciable effect on daily communication. The NNSS for the 14 participants treated monthly increased at a rate of 1·22, SEM 0·34 points per year compared with 2·92, SEM 0·27 points per year (p=0·0002) for the 21 patient comparison group. Decreased progression was observed for NNSS domains of ambulation (p=0·0622), cognition (p=0·0040) and speech (p=0·0423). Interpretation: Patients with NPC1 treated with intrathecal HPβCD had slowed disease progression with an acceptable safety profile.

PET scan,0,"May 10, 2021 [Press release] Ibudilast (MN-166) in ALS – an Open Label, Safety and Pharmacodynamic Trial ...MN-166 (ibudilast) is an oral experimental study medication known to inhibit microglial activation/neuroinflammation in preclinical studies. This early phase clinical trial evaluated the biological activity of MN-166 100mg/day on blood and brain PET imaging biomarkers in ALS. This biomarker-driven clinical trial was recently conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA and South Shore Neurological Associates, NY, USA. In this open label trial, 35 eligible ALS participants underwent ibudilast treatment up to 100 mg/day for 36 weeks. Of these, 30 participants were enrolled in the main study cohort and were included in biomarker, safety and tolerability analyses. Five additional participants were enrolled in the expanded access arm, who did not meet imaging eligibility criteria and were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. The study concludes that following treatment with MN-166 (ibudilast) in ALS participants, there were no (a) detectable biological impact of MN-166 up to 100mg/day dosages on lowering brain inflammation measured by PBR28-PET SUVR over 12–24 weeks (N=22 participants) or (b) lowering disease activity as measured by blood neurofilament light levels over 36–40 weeks (N=10 participants). Dose reductions and discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events were common at this dosage (100mg/day) in ALS participants. Overall 100mg/day MN-166 was safe and showed no drug related serious adverse events. Several participants experienced GI related, fatigue and insomnia adverse events. Thirty seven percent of study participants could not tolerate 100 mg/day and underwent dose reduction to 60 to 80 mg/day and 31% participants discontinued study drug early due to drug related adverse events. This study was not designed to make conclusions on clinical efficacy. A new larger trial is currently underway in the USA and Canada by MediciNova to evaluate the optimal dose range for safety, tolerability and efficacy of MN-166 in patients with ALS. This project was funded by an anonymous donor to the Mass General ALS research program and Ride for Life. Medicinova provided study drug, electronic database support, monitoring and partial funding support. We express our thanks and deep appreciation to all our ALS study participants and their families for their participation in the study. https://www.massgeneral.org//neurology/als/news/2021-05-10-Ibudilast-safety; April 15, 2021 Neuroimage Clin. 2021 Apr 15;30:102672.

Of these, 30 participants were enrolled in the main study cohort and were included in biomarker, safety and tolerability analyses. Five additional participants were enrolled in the expanded access arm, who did not meet imaging eligibility criteria and were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. The primary endpoints were median change from baseline in (a) PBR28-PET uptake in primary motor cortices, measured by standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) over 12-24 weeks and (b) serum NfL over 36-40 weeks. The secondary safety and tolerability endpoints were collected through Week 40. The baseline median (range) of PBR28-PET SUVR was 1.033 (0.847, 1.170) and NfL was 60.3 (33.1, 219.3) pg/ml. Participants who completed both pre and post-treatment scans had PBR28-PET SUVR median(range) change from baseline of 0.002 (-0.184, 0.156) , P = 0.5 (n = 22). The median(range) NfL change from baseline was 0.4 pg/ml (-1.8, 17.5), P = 0.2 (n = 10 participants). 30(86%) participants experienced at least one, possibly study drug related adverse event. 13(37%) participants could not tolerate 100 mg/day and underwent dose reduction to 60-80 mg/day and 11(31%) participants discontinued study drug early due to drug related adverse events. Conclusion: The study concludes that following treatment with ibudilast up to 100 mg/day in ALS participants, there were no significant reductions in (a) motor cortical glial activation measured by PBR28-PET SUVR over 12-24 weeks or (b) CNS neuroaxonal loss, measured by serum NfL over 36-40 weeks. Dose reductions and discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events were common at this dosage in ALS participants. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34016561/ Full text available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158221001169?via%3Dihub https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102622/; November 8, 2019 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 20, Issue supplement 1, November 2019 Presented at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 4-6, 2019, Perth, Australia Online published date: November 8, 2019 Abstract No.: C9 Suma Babu, Baileigh G.

Twenty-three ALS participants completed both pre- and post-treatment PBR-PET scans.Of this,sixteen participants remained on 100mg/day per protocol and seven were on 60–80mg/day due to adverse events. Scan Quality Checking(QC) was completed by independent imaging ana- lysts blinded to clinical data and 22 participants were included in final imaging analyses. Subjects had a median (range) PBR-PET SUVR increase of 0.15% (-17%, 13%) (Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank-Test V = 148, p = 0.5) following study treatment. The median (range) of PBR-PET SUVR was 1.035 (0.823, 1.172) before treatment and 1.019 (0.779, 1.295) after treatment. Conclusions: There was no significant reduction in motor cortical glial activation following 12–24 weeks of Ibudilast treatment in ALS, as measured by PBR- PET SUVR. Final clinical trial results including clinical and biofluid biomarker results will be available at the time of final presentation during MND Symposium 2019.

Highlights of the presentation, entitled ""Interaction (nonuniformity) of ALS Progression and the Efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast)”, which will be presented by Kazuko Matsuda, M.D. Ph.D. M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer of MediciNova, Inc., include the following: - We evaluated the potential background factors of patients’ characteristics that could reasonably predict both ALS disease progression and treatment efficacy. These factors included gender, age, race, site of onset (upper limb, lower limb, bulbar onset), UMN (upper motor neuron) / LMN (lower motor neuron) symptom involvement, and ALS history (i.e. days from first onset of symptom to trial enrollment). - Regression Tree Analysis and Stepwise Regression Analysis were performed to determine which potential factors have an impact on the treatment effect of MN-166 as assessed by the ALSFRS-R score. - The regression analyses determined that ALS history was a statistically significant factor affecting treatment effect (p=0.015). - Correlational Analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between (1) ALS history and baseline ALSFRS-R score, and (2) ALS history and disease progression, measured as change in ALSFRS-R score from baseline to end of treatment. - A significant negative correlation (-0.72, p<0.01) was observed between ALS history and baseline ALSFRS-R scores in patients with ALS onset <600 days prior to enrollment (i.e. short ALS history), but not in patients with ALS onset >600 days prior to enrollment (i.e. long ALS history). - A significant positive correlation (0.63, p<0.05) was observed between ALS history and ALS disease progression in the placebo group. With riluzole treatment only (without MN-166 treatment), greater disease progression was observed in short ALS history patients. - No correlation was observed between ALS history and ALS disease progression in the MN-166 group, which was attributed to the treatment effect in short ALS history patients. - The results of these analyses indicate that the efficacy of MN-166 is expected to be more robust in patients with a short ALS history. ...About the Phase 2 ALS Trial MediciNova, in collaboration with Dr. Benjamin Rix Brooks, Director, Carolinas Neuromuscular/ALS-MDA Center at Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute, evaluated 60 mg of MN-166 (ibudilast) per day in both early and advanced stage ALS patients. All subjects in the study received 100 mg of riluzole per day. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which included a six-month treatment period followed by a six-month open-label extension. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability and the study also evaluated several efficacy endpoints including functional activity (ALSFRS-R). Data analyzed from the 51 early ALS subjects (the intent-to-treat/ITT population) was presented at the 29th International Symposium on ALS/MND in Glasgow, Scotland, UK in December 2018. There was a higher percentage of responders on the ALSFRS-R total score, MMT (manual muscle testing) and ALSAQ-5 score (subjective quality-of-life questionnaire) in the MN-166 (ibudilast) group compared to the placebo group. This was the first study of MN-166 (ibudilast) in ALS and the study provides the necessary clinical data for powering assumptions for the Phase 3 trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) in ALS... https://investors.medicinova.com/news-releases/news-release-details/medicinova-announces-additional-analyses-completed-clinical; November 8, 2019 [Additoinal Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 20, Issue supplement 1, November 2019 Presented at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 4-6, 2019, Perth, Australia Online published date: November 8, 2019 Abstract No.: CLT-25 Kazuko Matsuda, Yuichi Iwaki, Malath Makhay, Joanna Dojillo, Seiichi Yasui Interaction (nonuniformity) of ALS Progression and the Efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast) Results: 1. A significant negative correlation (-0.72, p<0.01) was observed between ALS history and baseline ALSFRS-R scores in patients with ALS onset <600 days prior to enrollment (short ALS history). Patients with ALS onset >600 days prior to enrollment (long ALS history) had greater variability in baseline ALSFRS-R score. 2. A significant positive correlation (0.63, p<0.05) was observed between “ALS history” and “ALS disease progression” in the placebo group. Without MN-166 treatment, greater disease progression was observed in short ALS history patients. On the other hand, no correlation (point estimate =0.06, p=0.73) was observed with ALS history and ALS disease progression in the MN-166 group. Discussion and conclusions: 1. A significant correlation with lower baseline ALSFRS-R score at enrollment with time from disease onset was observed in short ALS history patients but not in long ALS history patients. 2. In placebo group, a significant correlation was observed in the shorter ALS history patients with higher rates of disease progression than those with longer ALS history. However, it was found that this correlation was lost in the MN-166 group and considered due to the treatment effect in short ALS history patients. The efficacy of MN-166 is expected to be effective in patients with a short ALS history.

Discontinuations were due to perceived lack of efficacy(11%)and nausea with/without bloatedsensation(23%). Overall mortality was significantly lower[HR=0.21 [95% CI -.06 to 0.81; P=0.0067]in PP-subjects compared with ET-subjects. NIV deployment was not statistically significantly different among DB/OLE/PP-epoch subjects but appeared delayed in PP subjects until treatment cessation. Examination of 26/31 EC-subjects two weeks subsequent to 6 months OLE treatment with ibudilast indicated significant loss of manual muscle testing strength in sentinel ALS muscles – neck flexion:-0.54+0.86(P=0.004), hip flexion:-0.65+0.89(P=0.001), hamstring flexion:-0.46+1.13(P=0.049)[mean difference +standard deviation(paired T test P)]with no change in ALSFRS-R or SVC. Conclusions: Ibudilast administration is tolerable and safe over 12 months in EC ALS subjects. PP completion was associated with lower mortality compared with ET completion. Sentinel ALS muscle strength was significantly reduced two weeks post cessation of ibudilast treatment. Further analysis is ongoing with preparation of complete summary when all 50 EC and 20 ANC subjects have completed the OLE epoch. http://submissions.mirasmart.com/Verify/AAN2017/submission/temp/rad0A3D3.pdf http://www.neurology.org/content/88/16_Supplement/P3.127 To Access the abstract: 1.

Interim results: Clinical Endpoint Exploratory analysis pointed to effect sizes reducing required patients from 321 (ALSFRS-R-total-score) per group to 102 (ALSFRS-R- bulbar-subscore) or 84 (ALSFRS-R-arm-subscore) per group in 6-month clinical trials. El Escorial Criteria (EEC) clinically-definite ALS (cdALS) significantly ( p = 0.0001) increased during DB clinical trial (0 months = 2.9 (95% CI = 2.73.1); 6 months = 3.3 (3.13.5)). Change in EEC in EC from clinically probable (cpALS) to cdALS during DB phase is significantly ( p = 0.028) proportionately higher (46.1%) in creatinine declining than not declining (11.1%) subgroups. EEC cdALS is significantly ( p = 0.005) proportionately higher in ANC (54.5%) than EC (12.9%) patients at clinical trial entry. Conclusions: Ibudilast administration is feasible/toler- able/safe when administered over 3 months and 6 months to no-NIV ALS (EC) subjects. Ibudilast administration showed effect size estimates at 6 months in bulbar and arm clinical domains that will help define clinical end- points for potential phase 3 clinical trials as well as pathways for adaptive change for this clinical trial. El Escorial Criteria disease burden increases significantly in ALS patients over 6 months and occurs significantly more in ALS patients showing decreased serum creatinine. Advanced NIV (ANC) ALS subjects have a higher proportion of El Escorial clinically definite disease and, as an enriched cohort, are safely participating in this clinical trial. The ANC patient group, enriched for cdALS, is potentially a vanguard for future clinical trials with a robust clinical trajectory that might be informative with respect to treatment effects on non-respiratory (bulbar, arm, leg) domains.

El Escorial Criteria(EEC)clinically-definite ALS(cdALS) significantly[P=0.0001]increases during DB clinical trial[0-months=2.9(95%CI=2.7-3.1); 6months=3.3(3.1-3.5)]. Change in EEC in EC from clinically probable(cpALS) to cdALS during DB phase is significantly [P=0.028]proportionately higher(46.1%) in creatinine declining than not declining(11.1%)sub-groups. EEC cdALS is significantly[P=0.005]proportionately higher in ANC(54.5%) than EC(12.9%)patients at clinical trial entry. Conclusions: Ibudilast administration is feasible,/tolerable/safe when administered over 3 months to EC ALS subjects. Longer feasibility/tolerability/safety data will be reported in EC ALS subjects over 6 months. Feasibility/tolerability/safety of Ibudilast treatment in ANC ALS subjects will provide, for the first time, information regarding the participation of ANC ALS patients in clinical trials of pharmacological agents at this stage of ALS. The ANC patient group, enriched for cdALS, is potentially a vanguard for future clinical trials with a robust clinical trajectory that might be informative with respect to treatment effects on non-respiratory [bulbar, arm, leg]domains. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4046/presentation/9742 [Full Poster] http://medicinova.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MN-166-ibudilast-for-ALS-American-Academy-of-Neurology-Poster.pdf","Secondary objective: To evaluate the clinical endpoint responsiveness of MN-166 60 mg/day versus placebo when administered with riluzole in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as measured by the following assessments. - Functional activity as assessed by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) - Respiratory function as measured by slow vital capacity (SVC), Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) also known as Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured under SVC protocol - Muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing (MMT) and instrumented hand grip dynamometry - Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) utilization measured by clinically indicated prescription for NIV intervention and time to clinically indicated prescription for NIV intervention in each group Secondary Outcome Measures: The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical endpoint responsiveness of MN-166 60 mg/d versus placebo when administered with riluzole in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as measured by Functional Activity [ Time Frame: 6 months ] Functional activity as assessed by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical endpoint responsiveness of MN-166 60 mg/d versus placebo when administered with riluzole in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as measured by Respiratory Function [ Time Frame: 6 months ] Respiratory function as measured by slow vital capacity (SVC), Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) also known as Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured under SVC protocol and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV).

Adverse Events Safety and Tolerability Treatment Emergent Adverse Events,0,"January 7, 2020 [Press release] InFlectis BioScience Announces Successful Completion of Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Oral IFB-088 InFlectis BioScience SAS... today announced the results of its Phase 1 study of IFB-088, an oral small molecule targeting the stress-induced PPP1R15A/PP1c phosphatase complex, in 72 healthy volunteers. Results of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study (SAD/MAD) demonstrated that administration of IFB-088 was safe and well tolerated. No serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, or clinically significant abnormalities were observed. The pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with data derived from extensive studies in animal models. Anne Visbecq, Chief Medical Officer of InFlectis BioScience SAS, said: “We are very pleased with the outcomes of the IFB-088 Phase 1 trial, which confirm the good tolerance profile of IFB-088 even in high dose groups. No safety concern has been identified and pharmacokinetics were as expected.” ""Results from this study provide the first clinical data for IFB-088 and creates a path forward for its evaluation as a potential first-in-class oral therapeutic treatment of CMT disease,"" commented Philippe Guédat, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, InFlectis BioScience. ""We look forward to working towards a U.S. and EMA IND filing in the coming months.” ABOUT THE IFB-088 PHASE 1 P188 CLINICAL TRIAL The Phase 1 P188 clinical trial, conducted in France, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of IFB-088, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IFB-088 in healthy subjects. The study enrolled 72 adult male volunteers into 6 SAD cohorts of 8 subjects, with IFB-088 given orally as single doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 60 mg daily, and 3 MAD cohorts of 8 subjects, with IFB-088 given orally at doses ranging from 15 to 50 mg/day for 14 consecutive days. https://inflectisbioscience.reportablenews.com/pr/inflectis-bioscience-announces-successful-completion-of-phase-1-clinical-trial-of-oral-ifb-088","Secondary Outcome Measures : Number of Participants With Change in Concomitant Medications [ Time Frame: SAD & MAD phases: Continuous (Screening visit to End of study visit (7 to 14 days after last dosing) + 30 days) ] modification in Concomitant medication(s) occuring during the study (if applicable) Pharmacokinetic: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) [ Time Frame: Starting 1 hour prior to dosing on Day 1 and until 72 hours after last dosing (Day 17) ] Plasma samples are collected: SAD phase - cohort 1 (one intake for daily administration): Day 1 at predose, 0.16, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 24, 32 hours SAD phase - cohort 2 to 6 (two intakes for daily administration): Day 1 at predose, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12.25, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 18, 24, 32 hours MAD phase (two intakes for daily administration): Day 1 and Day 14 at predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 and 21h ; Day 2 (24 hours); Day 7 (predose, 1h and 2 h post dose); Day 15 (24, 30, 36 and 42 hours after Day 14); Day 16 (48, 60 hours after Day 14).

The PK of ILB in patients with ALS was similar to that seen in healthy controls. The ILB injection elicited a transient elevation of plasma Hepatocyte Growth Factor, a neurotrophic and myogenic growth factor. Following the ILB injections patients reported increased vitality, decreased spasticity and increased mobility. The ALSFRS-R rating improved from 36.31 + or - 6.66 to 38.77 + or - 6.44 and the Norris rating also improved from 70.61 + or - 13.91 to 77.85 + or - 14.24 by Day 36. The improvement of functions was associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy biomarkers. These therapeutic benefits decreased 3-4 weeks after the last dosage. Conclusions: This pilot clinical study demonstrates safety and tolerability of ILB® in patients with ALS. The exploratory biomarker and functional measures must be cautiously interpreted but suggest clinical benefit and have a bearing on the mechanism of action of ILB®. The results support the drug's potential as the first disease modifying treatment for patients with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35613082/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/35613082/ https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267183 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9132272/pdf/pone.0267183.pdf; August 16, 2021 [Press release] TIKOMED’S ILB attenuates clinical symptoms and serum biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with ALS in data published by the Journal of Personalized Medicine Viken – 16th August 2021 – New study results for Tikomed’s platform lead drug candidate ILB in the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have now been published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine. The data revealed a significant normalization of the serum levels of several key metabolites in addition to a significant improvement of patients’ clinical conditions for the duration of the ILB treatment period. The treatment response appears to be mediated by improvement of tissue bioenergetics, decrease of oxidative/nitrosative stress and attenuation of (neuro)inflammatory processes. ... In this study of a cohort of patients with ALS who had participated in the clinical trial entitled ‘A single-centre, open single-arm study on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of subcutaneously administered ILB in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’3, repeated ILB administration over four weeks led to a significant attenuation of the levels of key serum metabolites related to neural damage, oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial derangement. “We are very pleased that these results strongly suggest that ILB treatment produces metabolic benefits corresponding with the encouraging clinical improvements seen for the ALS patients participating in this study”, said Anders Kristensson, CEO of Tikomed. “The adaptive, multi modal mechanism of action of ILB and the growing scientific evidence supporting it’s ability to rebalance the body’s own inflammatory response and enhance endogenous repair mechanisms gives us the limitless potential to pursue all disease areas driven by uncontrolled or dysfunctional inflammation, on our quest to provide safe and affordable medicines to as many patients as possible across the globe”... https://www.tikomed.com/2021/08/16/tikomeds-ilb-attenuates-clinical-symptoms-and-serum-biomarkers-of-oxidative-nitrosative-stress-and-mitochondrial-dysfunction-in-patients-with-als-in-data-published-by-the-journal-of-per/; August 14, 2021 J Pers Med. 2021 Aug 14;11(8):794.

An improved serum metabolic profile was accompanied by significant amelioration of the patients' clinical conditions, indicating a response to ILB® treatment that appears to be mediated by improvement of tissue bioenergetics, decrease of oxidative/nitrosative stress and attenuation of (neuro)inflammatory processes. Conclusion; In conclusion, although obtained in a restricted number of patients (not allowing to evaluate potential age and/or sex differences of the serum biochemical analyses) this longitudinal study produced very encouraging results concerning the effects of ILB® administration to patients suffering from ALS. As there are no current effective drug treatments licensed for clinical use other than riluzole that has a very limited benefit, the present findings indicate the utility of pharmacological interventions positively acting on the ALS-induced metabolic changes, specifically on energy-related mitochondrial functions, oxidative/nitrosative stress and amino acid metabolism https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34442438/ Full text available at: https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/11/8/794/htm; October 09, 2020 [Press release] Update regarding our Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) study conducted at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden Our Phase IIa clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and possible efficacy of subcutaneous injections of ILB® in ALS is finalized and has been reported to the Swedish Medical Products Agency.

Of the remaining 28 patients, 43% developed UMN signs and were diagnosed with ALS, 32% developed bulbar and respiratory symptoms and were diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) and 25% developed progressive spreading LMN limb weakness and were diagnosed with probable PMA. All responders demonstrated distal upper limb (UL) onset weakness, EMG abnormalities confined to the clinically weak muscles, and a normal CK. This set of features was also identified in 31% of non-responders pre- senting with distal UL weakness. Gender, age at onset, number of involved limb regions and the duration of symptoms prior to treatment were not significantly different between groups. Significant side effects from IVIg therapy were reported by 39% of patients. Discussion: The rate of response to IVIg in this series was considerably lower than previously published studies (response rates, 40 – 74%), possibly due to previous studies reporting selected groups of patients, and including patients with some electrophysiological features of demyelination, hence increasing the likelihood of an underlying inflammatory etiology.

Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over Study of Incobotulinum Toxin A for Troublesome Drooling in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Results: Nine of 10 subjects completed the study (6 male, 3 female; mean age/SD 68 +/- 0.92). Primary outcome was the difference in saliva weight between baseline and one month post-injection in drug vs. placebo periods: mean reduction/SD 0.33g +/- 0.95 (95% CI: -0.31 to 0.97) favoring treatment. Secondary outcomes: DSFS difference between baseline and one month post-injection in drug vs. placebo periods: mean reduction/SD 0.22 +/- 1.9 (95% CI: -0.99 to 1.68) favoring treatment. DSFS decreased > or = 2 points in 2/9 subjects on drug vs. 1/9 on placebo. Saliva weight decreased > or = 20% in 3/9 subjects on drug vs. 2/9 on placebo. Regression analysis of saliva weight and DSFS over time showed a steeper slope in the treatment period (-0.139 vs -0.035 and -0.11 vs. -0.06, p NS). In 6/9 subjects who continued treatment post-trial there was greater decrease in saliva weight (0.8g +/- 0.8) and DSFS (0.5 +/- 1.6) vs. 3/9 who did not continue treatment (0.6g +/- 0.6 and 1.6 +/- 2 respectively).

One participant was unable to comply with study visits and was lost to follow-up. Serum urate rose to target levels in 6 weeks. No serious AEs attributed to study drug and no AEs of special concern, such as urolithiasis and gout, occurred. Selected biomarkers of oxidative stress and damage had significant changes during the study period. Observed changes in ALSFRS-R did not differ from baseline predictions. Interpretation Inosine appeared safe, well tolerated, and effective in raising serum urate levels in people with ALS. These findings, together with epidemiological observations and preclinical data supporting a neuroprotective role of urate in ALS models, provide the rationale for larger clinical trials testing inosine as a potential disease-modifying therapy for ALS. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.671 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acn3.671 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564619 Full study article available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6292193/pdf/ACN3-5-1522.pdf; November 8, 2016 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, 2016; 17(Suppl.

Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None=0, Questionable=0.5, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The CDR-SB is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates clinical decline. Change From Baseline to Week 76 on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-ADL-MCI) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 76 ] The ADCS-ADL-MCI consists of 17 instrumental items (e.g., shopping, preparing meals, using household appliances) and 1 basic item (getting dressed). Ratings reflect caregiver observations about the participant's actual functioning and provide an assessment of change in the functional state of the participant over time. The total score ranges from 0 to 53, with lower values over time reflecting functional deterioration. Positive change from baseline indicates clinical improvement. Change From Baseline to Week 76 on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 76 ] ADAS-Cog13 comprises both cognitive tasks and clinical ratings of cognitive performance. The scale items capture word recall, ability to follow commands, the ability to correctly copy or draw an image, naming, the ability to interact with everyday objects, orientation, word recognition, memory, comprehension of spoken language, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure for delayed word recall and concentration/distractibility. The total score ranges from 0 to 85. An increase in score over time indicates increasing cognitive impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates clinical decline. Change From Baseline to Week 76 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 76 ] The MMSE is a widely used performance-based test of global cognitive status. It consists of 11 tasks that assess orientation, word recall, attention and calculation, language abilities, and visuospatial functions. The scores from the 11 tests are combined to obtain the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores over time indicating increasing cognitive impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates clinical improvement. Change From Baseline to Week 76 on the Modified Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 76 ] iADRS is a composite and is calculated as a linear combination of total scores of ADAS-Cog13 and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL) that measures cognition and daily function. ADCS-iADL is calculated from a subset of questions from ADCS-ADL. Range for ADCS-iADL is 0-59 and higher scores reflect better performance. ADAS-Cog13 comprises cognitive tasks and clinical ratings of cognitive performance. Scale items capture word recall, ability to follow commands, ability to correctly copy/draw, naming, ability to interact with everyday objects, orientation, word recognition, memory, spoken language comprehension, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure for delayed word recall and concentration/distractibility.

The study demonstrated statistically significant efficacy as measured by change in the slope decline of ALSFRS-R. The drug was well tolerated, and the study suggests benefits in weight gain, respiration, and survival. Neurofilament (NfL) reduction was observed following IPL344 treatment. In this study, once-daily treatment with IPL344 for up to 36 months was well tolerated, with no major drug related serious adverse events (SAE). No participants discontinued treatment due to drug-related AEs. IPL344 treated patients showed a mean slope of decline in ALSFRS-R of -0.53, equating 48% slower disease progression (p=0.028). Adjustment for disease stage and rate-indicating covariates, indicated a 64% slower ALSFRS-R progression (p=0.034). In addition, a statistically significant increase rather than decrease was observed in body weight of IPL344 treated patients (p=0.02; compared to the PRO-ACT database of patients treated with placebo). Median survival of patients in this study was 29 months vs. 19 months of placebo treated patients in the ceftriaxone study (post-treatment follow-up is still ongoing), indicating a trend toward reduced risk of death in favor of IPL344 (p=0.13). There was a non-significant trend for preserved respiration capacity (44% slower reduction in average %SVC loss per month vs. historical placebo; p=0.15). Biomarker data for plasma neurofilament light (NfL) levels were obtained for eight subjects. NfL concentrations were reduced during IPL344 treatment in all but one participant. In the six subjects that had blood sampling past the initial dose-escalating phase, plasma NfL concentrations were reduced by a mean of 20%, suggesting decrease of neuronal injury following IPL344 treatment. “We are excited that treatment with IPL344 was well tolerated in people with ALS and demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy across multiple parameters. This data will soon be submitted for publication in a scientific journal,” said Dr. Ilana Cohen, Immunity Pharma’s VP of R&D. “If confirmed in a subsequent larger phase 3 study, the magnitude of reduction in ALSFRS-R progression observed in this study is greater than that achieved with currently approved drugs.” “These early-stage data support further development of IPL344 as a treatment for ALS, and merit further investigation in a large number of participants. We intend to progress PL344 to a pivotal clinical trial in ALS,” said Immunity’s CEO, Eran Ovadia... https://immunitypharma.com/news/64-immunity-pharma-announces-positive-top-line-results-from-phase-2a-trial-with-ipl344-in-als-patients; December 20, 2023 [Pooled analysis] Ilana Cohen PhD, Yossef Lerner MD, Eran Ovadia MBA, Marc Gotkine MBBS Neurofi lament light chain level change in plasma of ALS pati ents following IPL344 treatment in phase 1/2a clinical trial (NCT03652805, NCT03755167) Conclusions • We have previously reported ALSFRS-R slope reducti ons of 48-64% in this small, fi rst-in-human study compared to historical controls and 67% compared to individual pretreatment slope, a slope steeper than ΔFRS used in this analysis.8 • The reducti on of NfL following IPL344 treatment and the correlati on between NfL reducti on and ALSFRS-R slope reducti on, support the clinical data indicati ng that IPL344 merits further explorati on as a potenti al disease modifying treatment. • We hypothesize that NfL levels will be a useful biomarker to investi gate effi cacy in a planned controlled trial of IPL344. https://immunitypharma.com/images/publications/ImmunityPharma%20NfL%20December%202023%20Poster.pdf; November 15, 2023 [Pooled Analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. BIO-02 I.

Gotkine; Neurofilament light chain level in plasma of ALS patients following IPL344 treatment in phase 1/2a clinical trial (NCT03652805, NCT03755167) Results: NfL levels were reduced or were stable in all patients, except for one patient who died shortly after enrol- ment. A mean reduction of 20% in NfL levels was detected in treated patients. There was a linear correlation between % plasma NfL reduction and reduction in ALSFRS-R slope fol- lowing IPL344 treatment (p ¼ 0.01). Conclusions: We previously reported ALSFRS-R slope reduction of 64% in this clinical study. The reduction of NfL levels and the correlation between NfL reduction and ALSFRS-R slope reduc- tion following IPL344 treatment supports a disease modifying effect. Moreover, these data further support the use of NfL as a valid outcome measure in ALS treatment trials.

Gotkine, D. Schoenfeld, I. Cohen, J. Shefner, Y. Lerner, I. Cohen, C. Klein, E. Ovadia and M. Cudkowicz; First in human phase 1/2a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Akt activator, IPL344 in ALS (NCT03652805, NCT03755167) Results: A total of 9 participants with ALS were treated and analyzed according to ITT for an average treatment period of 14.0 months per patient. IPL344 was well tolerated with no major safety concerns. The most common treatment related adverse event was low grade CVC related, which resolved without sequelae. A single drug-related hypersensitivity event after 12 months of treatment was resolved by reducing the rate of infusion. IPL344 treatment led to a 67% slower ALSFRS-R progression rate (p¼ 0.0001) compared to the participants’ pretreatment lead-in rate (points/month). The progression of IPL344-treated participants compared to the placebo-treated PRO-ACT participants manifested 49% slower progression of ALSFRS-R (p¼ 0.027), corrected for the variation between studies. Correcting for progression-related covariates using the pooled PRO-ACT database of placebo studies showed > 67% slower ALSFRS-R progression (p¼ 0.0028), and 51% slower %SVC loss per month (p¼ 0.24); treated subjects gained weight, while those in PRO-ACT lost weight (p¼ 0.03). Survival was compared to the Ceftriaxone study placebo, for its distinguished long duration: Preliminary analysis based on follow-up after treatment termination showed 70% lower risk of death (p¼ 0.13). Initial (ongoing) pilot studies measuring Akt activation in leucocytes from IPL344-treated participants as a biomarker suggested successful target engagement. Conclusions: IPL344 treatment was safe with signals of efficacy indicating 49–67% slower progression in several outcome parameters. These results warrant further evaluation in randomized placebo-controlled study, currently being planned.

The study demonstrated statistically significant efficacy as measured by change in the slope decline of ALSFRS-R. The drug was well tolerated, and the study suggests benefits in weight gain, respiration, and survival. Neurofilament (NfL) reduction was observed following IPL344 treatment. In this study, once-daily treatment with IPL344 for up to 36 months was well tolerated, with no major drug related serious adverse events (SAE). No participants discontinued treatment due to drug-related AEs. IPL344 treated patients showed a mean slope of decline in ALSFRS-R of -0.53, equating 48% slower disease progression (p=0.028). Adjustment for disease stage and rate-indicating covariates, indicated a 64% slower ALSFRS-R progression (p=0.034). In addition, a statistically significant increase rather than decrease was observed in body weight of IPL344 treated patients (p=0.02; compared to the PRO-ACT database of patients treated with placebo). Median survival of patients in this study was 29 months vs. 19 months of placebo treated patients in the ceftriaxone study (post-treatment follow-up is still ongoing), indicating a trend toward reduced risk of death in favor of IPL344 (p=0.13). There was a non-significant trend for preserved respiration capacity (44% slower reduction in average %SVC loss per month vs. historical placebo; p=0.15). Biomarker data for plasma neurofilament light (NfL) levels were obtained for eight subjects. NfL concentrations were reduced during IPL344 treatment in all but one participant. In the six subjects that had blood sampling past the initial dose-escalating phase, plasma NfL concentrations were reduced by a mean of 20%, suggesting decrease of neuronal injury following IPL344 treatment. “We are excited that treatment with IPL344 was well tolerated in people with ALS and demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy across multiple parameters. This data will soon be submitted for publication in a scientific journal,” said Dr. Ilana Cohen, Immunity Pharma’s VP of R&D. “If confirmed in a subsequent larger phase 3 study, the magnitude of reduction in ALSFRS-R progression observed in this study is greater than that achieved with currently approved drugs.” “These early-stage data support further development of IPL344 as a treatment for ALS, and merit further investigation in a large number of participants. We intend to progress PL344 to a pivotal clinical trial in ALS,” said Immunity’s CEO, Eran Ovadia... https://immunitypharma.com/news/64-immunity-pharma-announces-positive-top-line-results-from-phase-2a-trial-with-ipl344-in-als-patients; December 20, 2023 [Pooled analysis] Ilana Cohen PhD, Yossef Lerner MD, Eran Ovadia MBA, Marc Gotkine MBBS Neurofi lament light chain level change in plasma of ALS pati ents following IPL344 treatment in phase 1/2a clinical trial (NCT03652805, NCT03755167) Conclusions • We have previously reported ALSFRS-R slope reducti ons of 48-64% in this small, fi rst-in-human study compared to historical controls and 67% compared to individual pretreatment slope, a slope steeper than ΔFRS used in this analysis.8 • The reducti on of NfL following IPL344 treatment and the correlati on between NfL reducti on and ALSFRS-R slope reducti on, support the clinical data indicati ng that IPL344 merits further explorati on as a potenti al disease modifying treatment. • We hypothesize that NfL levels will be a useful biomarker to investi gate effi cacy in a planned controlled trial of IPL344. https://immunitypharma.com/images/publications/ImmunityPharma%20NfL%20December%202023%20Poster.pdf; November 15, 2023 [Pooled Analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. BIO-02 I.

A mean reduction of 20% in NfL levels was detected in treated patients. There was a linear correlation between % plasma NfL reduction and reduction in ALSFRS-R slope fol- lowing IPL344 treatment (p ¼ 0.01). Conclusions: We previously reported ALSFRS-R slope reduction of 64% in this clinical study. The reduction of NfL levels and the correlation between NfL reduction and ALSFRS-R slope reduc- tion following IPL344 treatment supports a disease modifying effect. Moreover, these data further support the use of NfL as a valid outcome measure in ALS treatment trials.

Cudkowicz; First in human phase 1/2a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Akt activator, IPL344 in ALS (NCT03652805, NCT03755167) Results: A total of 9 participants with ALS were treated and analyzed according to ITT for an average treatment period of 14.0 months per patient. IPL344 was well tolerated with no major safety concerns. The most common treatment related adverse event was low grade CVC related, which resolved without sequelae. A single drug-related hypersensitivity event after 12 months of treatment was resolved by reducing the rate of infusion. IPL344 treatment led to a 67% slower ALSFRS-R progression rate (p¼ 0.0001) compared to the participants’ pretreatment lead-in rate (points/month). The progression of IPL344-treated participants compared to the placebo-treated PRO-ACT participants manifested 49% slower progression of ALSFRS-R (p¼ 0.027), corrected for the variation between studies. Correcting for progression-related covariates using the pooled PRO-ACT database of placebo studies showed > 67% slower ALSFRS-R progression (p¼ 0.0028), and 51% slower %SVC loss per month (p¼ 0.24); treated subjects gained weight, while those in PRO-ACT lost weight (p¼ 0.03). Survival was compared to the Ceftriaxone study placebo, for its distinguished long duration: Preliminary analysis based on follow-up after treatment termination showed 70% lower risk of death (p¼ 0.13). Initial (ongoing) pilot studies measuring Akt activation in leucocytes from IPL344-treated participants as a biomarker suggested successful target engagement. Conclusions: IPL344 treatment was safe with signals of efficacy indicating 49–67% slower progression in several outcome parameters. These results warrant further evaluation in randomized placebo-controlled study, currently being planned.

Healey & AMG Center for ALS, and chief of the Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, the open-label study, divided into a 28-day dose escalation phase a voluntary long-term extension, showed that IPL344 was well-tolerated with no major safety concerns. Presented at the 2022 Annual Northeast Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (NEALS) Meeting, November 1-3, in Clearwater Beach, Florida, IPL344-treated patients had a 67% slower ALSFRS-R progression rate compared with the participants’ pre-treatment lead-in rate (P = .0001). Patients were on IPL344 for an average of 11 months of treatment. All told, the mean ALSFRS-R slopes for IPL344 vs PRO-ACT pooled placebo revealed a 49% estimated difference (–1.03 vs –0.52; P = .027) that favored IPL344. After adjustment, the differences in slopes grew bigger (–1.02 vs –0.19; 81%; P = .026). In the analysis comparing IPL344 to pre-treatment lead-in rate, the model assumed that ALSFRS-R during the lead-in period had a linear trajectory that varies with patients, and it also had a different linear trajectory during treatment that also varies with patients. https://www.neurologylive.com/view/akt-activator-ipl344-demonstrates-safety-signs-efficacy-phase-1-2-study-als; September 10, 2020 [Press release] Immunity Pharma Announces Promising Interim Results of its Phase 1/2a Study with IPL344 in ALS - Early indications for clinically significant efficacy during IPL344 treatment of ALS patients (ALSFRS-R and SVC) - IPL344 established a favorable safety and tolerability profile - A biomarker demonstrated that daily IPL344 treatment restored normal Akt activation levels in ALS patients Jerusalem, Israel, September 10th 2020 – Immunity Pharma, a clinical-stage neurology-focused biopharmaceutical company, announced today interim results from its Phase 1/2a clinical study with IPL344, an Akt activating disease-modifying drug for the treatment of ALS. In this early stage clinical trial, disease progression rate during IPL344 treatment was about 50% slower than expected without treatment, in both functional and respiratory endpoints (ALSFRS-R and SVC, respectively). The drug also demonstrated a very favorable safety and tolerability profile. These results reflect a potentially favorable impact on patients’ quality of life, and are well established predictors for patients’ survival. Testing for an Akt activation biomarker demonstrated target engagement, confirming IPL344’s ability to activate the pro-survival Akt pathway in patients suffering from ALS. The Phase 1/2a trial is an open-label, dose-ranging study with once-daily IPL344 treatment of rapidly progressing ALS patients. Subjects enroll into a 28-day Phase 1 safety study that is followed by a long-term open-label Phase 2a efficacy study. Patients started treatment at ALSFRS-R values between 22 and 38 (on a 48-point scale). At this stage of the disease ALSFRS-R deterioration is linear, or even faster than linear, as established by the analysis of ALS progression in large populations. So far, 8 patients have completed the 28 days safety study. No drug related adverse events were observed in any of this study participants. Six (6) patients were treated beyond 4 months, for an average duration of 8 months (4 – 13 months). Among these 6 patients the deterioration rate of ALSFRS-R was 49% slower than before treatment (p = 0.08). Change in disease progression was observed starting mainly after the first two months of treatment. The disease progression rate beyond these first two months, i.e., during the remaining 6 months (on average) of treatment, was 61% slower (P = 0.03) than before treatment (as measured in 6 months on average before treatment). The projected linear deterioration rate is an established surrogate for a placebo group in early clinical trials in ALS; it is based on a large body of published research, studying disease progression in thousands of untreated ALS patients. During the average 8 months of treatment study participants lost, on average, 4.7 fewer ALSFRS-R points compared to their projected loss assuming a linear deterioration rate (i.e., their own pre-treatment deterioration rate). The effect on respiration was measured by Slow Vital Capacity (SVC). Average SVC loss in the general ALS population (including slow progressors) is known to be 3.1% per month for patients with ALSFRS-R<40. During IPL344 treatment the 6 participants lost only 1.3% SVC per month on average, representing 57% slower deterioration in respiration. These observations are in line with earlier data obtained from single rapidly-progressing patient treated with IPL344 under a compassionate treatment protocol. That patient, who started at an advanced stage of the disease (ALSFRS-R=15), lost only a single ALSFRS-R point during the first 22 months of IPL344 treatment. The compassionate treatment patient survived under treatment for a total of 26 months, much beyond expected survival for a patient at that stage... ...Biomarker data from patients in this Phase 1/2a study confirm, in a statistically significant manner, that IPL344 restored Akt activation levels in patients back to their normal levels. This confirms target engagement under disease conditions, and demonstrates the remarkable capability of IPL344 to activate Akt in patients suffering from ALS. “The results presented so far, in Immunity Pharma’s clinical trial and the preceding compassionate treatment with IPL344, are encouraging. This is said with the necessary caution given that it is based on 6 patients that were treated for 8 months on average, and a compassionate patient treated for 26 months. While establishing efficacy requires a large placebo-controlled study, the magnitude of the effect observed in this study, if repeated in a larger pivotal study, will have a clinically meaningful impact on ALS patients. We are looking forward to continue the collaboration with Immunity Pharma towards further development of this drug” said the study’s principal investigator Dr. Marc Gotkine, head of the ALS clinic, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem... ...About the Phase 1/2a ALS Clinical Trial The Phase 1/2a trial is an open-label, dose-ranging study with once-daily IPL344 treatment administered IV (home administration). Subjects are allowed to stay in the study for up to 3 years. The study includes a 28-day Phase 1 portion, after which subjects may continue to the Phase 2a portion of the study. The study is expected to include 15 ALS patients and is conducted at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. All participants are rapidly progressing ALS patients, with above median ALS progressing rate as measured by change rate of the standard disease score ALSFRS-R (ranged 0 to 48, healthy). The patients started treatment at ALSFRS-R values of 22-38. All 7 subjects of Cohort 1 were already recruited to the study (a daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg of IPL344), with subjects are currently being recruited into Cohort 2 (8 subjects; a daily dose of 4.5 mg/kg of IPL344).

In order to quantitate these findings, we selected 30 miRNA of interest and conducted qPCR to measure differential expression.Eight miRNA sequences significantly distinguished ALS/MND patients from controls in this replicated experiment of two independent cohorts. In order to determine the specificity of our eight miRNA fingerprint, we compared these findings to plasma samples from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and additional control samples. We report no significant difference in the eight miRNA markers in AD patients compared to controls. This confirms that our eight miRNA fingerprint is not a measure of neurodegeneration alone but is likely specific to ALS. Discussion: Neural-enriched extracellular vesicles from blood plasma resulted in a unique set of miRNA sequences which may yield new insights ALS disease mechanisms. These eight miRNA are being further investigated to see if they can assist in early diagnosis of ALS/MND.

The ALSFRS-R provides a physician-generated estimate of the patient's degree of functional impairment, which can be evaluated serially to objectively assess any response to treatment or progression of disease. The ALSFRS includes ten questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patients level of functional impairment in performing one of ten common tasks, e.g. climbing stairs. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 40=best.

Studies of Environmental Risk Factors in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and a Phase I Clinical Trial of L-Serine. Methods: In the phase I trial of L-serine, two patients withdrew from because of gastrointestinal side effects. Three patients died during the study, which was about the expected number. The ALSFRS-R in the L-serine-treated patients showed a dose-related decrease in the rate of progression (34% reduction in slope, P = 0.044). The non-random distribution of addresses of ALS patients suggests that residential exposure to environmental pollutants may play an important role in the etiology of ALS. Conclusion: L-Serine in doses up to 15 g twice daily appears to be safe in patients with ALS. Exploratory studies of efficacy suggested that L-serine might slow disease progression.

Abstract No.: 128 Walter Bradley, dan moore, Robert Miller, David Saperstein, Dallas Forshew Trials of L-serine in ALS Results: Two patients withdrew because of gastro-intestinal side effects (bloating, 15 g twice daily for 4 months; nausea and loss of appetite, 7.5 g twice daily for one month). One other patient had loss of appetite (2.5 g twice daily) but completed the trial. Three patients died during the study, which was about the expected number. The ALSFRS-R in the L-serine-treated patients showed a dose-related decrease in the rate of progression (linear mixed effects model corrected for initial FVC and symptom duration, 34% reduction in slope, p=0.044). The rate of decline of FVC in the L-serine patients did not differ from that in the historical placebo controls. L-serine concentration in the CSF showed a ~4-fold rise at the end of the study in the highest dose group. BMAA was not detected in the blood or CSF, confirming the findings of others. Conclusions: L-serine in doses up to 15 g twice daily appears to be safe in patients with ALS.Exploratory studies of efficacy showed no evidence that L-serine caused disease acceleration and suggested the possibility of a dose-related slowing of disease progression.

Ludolph TWELVE-MONTH RESULTS IN FTD-C9ORF72 PARTICIPANTS FROM INFRONT-2: A PHASE 2 STUDY OF LATOZINEMAB (AL001) IN FTD Results: Latozinemab was generally safe and well-tolerated in FTD-C9orf72 participants in INFRONT-2. As previously demonstrated, chronic dosing led to a sustained 2-3-fold increase in PGRN levels in plasma and CSF throughout 12 months of treatment. The rate of clinical progression did not differ between participants receiving latozinemab in INFRONT-2 and untreated matched controls in ALLFTD. The estimate of the treatment effect (ALLFTD-latozinemab) was -0.5 CDR units with a high degree of variability [95% CI -2.96, 2.05] associated with the estimate. GFAP and NfL levels in both plasma and CSF were unchanged over the course of treatment. Conclusion: Latozinemab treatment effects were not observed on the rate of clinical disease progression or on plasma biomarkers other than PGRN. The small sample size and a high degree of variability in disease progression in both groups rendered the results uninformative regarding treatment effect in this open-label study. However, there remains a great unmet need for effective therapies in FTD. Latozinemab is being developed for the treatment of FTD-GRN and FTD-C9orf72. A larger placebo-controlled trial is needed to definitively assess the therapeutic potential of latozinemab in treating FTD-C9orf72.

(Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, presented results from the INFRONT-2 Phase 2 clinical trial of AL001 (latozinemab) in frontotemporal dementia patients (FTD) with a C9orf72 genetic mutation (FTD-C9orf72) at the AD/PD 2022 International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and related neurological disorders taking place virtually and in person in Barcelona, Spain. Latozinemab is a potential first-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin, a key regulator of immune activity and lysosomal health in the brain. In 2021, Alector presented results showing that latozinemab elevated progranulin levels in a cohort of symptomatic carriers of the progranulin mutation causative of FTD (FTD-GRN) patients for the duration of treatment, and as compared to matched controls, showed associated changes in exploratory biomarkers and a trend toward a delay in annual disease progression. Today’s data from the FTD-C9orf72 cohort build upon the results observed in the Company’s studies to date in FTD-GRN patients. The results presented include 12-month data from up to 10 symptomatic FTD-C9orf72 patients treated with 60 mg/kg of latozinemab every four weeks in an open-label study designed to primarily assess the safety and tolerability of chronic dosing. The study also includes exploratory clinical outcomes assessments and biomarkers. Highlights from the presentation included the following observations: Latozinemab was generally well tolerated when administered monthly for a year or more, consistent with other study cohorts. Latozinemab elevated progranulin in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in FTD-C9orf72 patients for the duration of treatment. Clinical outcome assessments using the CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scale, a standard FTD clinical rating instrument that assesses cognitive, functional, behavioral and language impairments over time, found that when compared to a matched control cohort from the ALLFTD consortium, treatment with latozinemab in FTD-C9orf72 patients resulted in a trend toward a delay of approximately 54 percent in annualized disease progression. Mean levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of axonal damage, remained stable over the course of treatment in both plasma and CSF in latozinemab-treated FTD-C9orf72 patients. Mean levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrogliosis that is an indicator of disease and/or injury to the central nervous system, decreased over 12 months in both plasma and CSF in latozinemab-treated FTD-C9orf72 patients. INFRONT-2 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results The open-label study was designed to assess safety and tolerability of chronic dosing of latozinemab, as well as to gather data related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, exploratory biomarkers of pharmacologic activity and efficacy. INFRONT-2 included three cohorts of patients with FTD: asymptomatic FTD-GRN mutation carriers, symptomatic FTD-GRN patients, and symptomatic FTD-C9orf72 patients. Data presented today focused on the FTD-C9orf72 cohort and included 12-month data for up to 10 patients with at least one post-baseline clinical outcomes assessment, who received 60 mg/kg of latozinemab every four weeks. As of the data cut, six FTD-C9orf72 patients had completed 12 months of treatment and all biomarker and clinical outcomes assessments. Latozinemab was well tolerated in the INFRONT-2 study. Twenty-eight study participants from all three cohorts were assessed for safety, with twenty-one patients treated for 12 months or more. Within the FTD-C9orf72 cohort there were a total of seven treatment related AEs, all of which were mild or moderate. Treatment with latozinemab in the FTD-C9orf72 cohort resulted in elevated levels of progranulin when measured in both the plasma and CSF. The CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scores in the ALLFTD matched control cohort had a projected annual increase of 3.4 points from baseline over one year. By comparison, the projected annual increase in the latozinemab treated FTD-C9orf72 cohort (N=10) from baseline was estimated at 1.6 points over one year. This suggested a trend toward an approximately 54 percent decrease in the annualized rate of clinical progression for patients treated with latozinemab. In order to provide context for the clinical outcomes assessed in the FTD-C9orf72 patients enrolled in the open-label INFRONT-2 study, a matched control cohort of FTD-C9orf72 patients from the ALLFTD database was created using propensity score matching and blinded clinical adjudication. ALLFTD is a comprehensive natural history study of FTD collecting cognitive and behavior assessment data, as well as imaging, blood and CSF biomarkers co-directed by Dr. Brad Boeve at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Drs. Adam Boxer and Howard Rosen, at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). A total of 10 ALLFTD patients were identified whose baseline cognitive assessment scores and characteristics, including age, sex, NfL level at baseline and diagnosis or variant of FTD-C9orf72, were comparable to those of the FTD-C9orf72 patient cohort in the INFRONT-2 Phase 2 study. Propensity score matching and clinical adjudication was performed by researchers blinded to the one-year follow-up data from the ALLFTD matched control cohort. Cognitive assessment was measured using the CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scale, a standard FTD clinical rating instrument that assesses cognitive, functional, behavioral and language impairments over time. Changes in exploratory biomarkers from baseline to 12-months were also assessed. NfL, a marker of axonal damage, was measured in plasma and CSF.

(Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, presented encouraging results from the company’s INFRONT-2 Phase 2 clinical trial of AL001 at the 14th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference taking place virtually and in Boston. AL001 is a potential first-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to elevate progranulin, a key regulator of immune activity in the brain. Decreased progranulin levels due to genetic mutations are a known cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a rare and rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is the most common form of dementia for people under the age of 60. AL001 is initially being developed for the treatment of adults at risk for or with symptomatic FTD due to a progranulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN). The INFRONT-2 Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of chronic dosing of AL001 in symptomatic FTD-GRN patients treated for up to 96 weeks. Highlights from the presentation included observations that: - AL001 restored progranulin to normal levels (based on age-matched controls) in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the duration of treatment. - Multiple biomarkers of lysosomal dysfunction and complement activation, known to be elevated in FTD-GRN, decreased toward normal levels (based on age-matched controls) following treatment with AL001. - Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrogliosis that is an indicator of disease and/or injury to the central nervous system, was elevated at baseline and decreased towards normal levels (vs. asymptomatic FTD-GRN mutation carriers following AL001 treatment. - AL001 treatment was estimated to slow disease progression at twelve months by 48% based on 12 patients as compared to a matched control cohort of participants from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI2 (1)) - AL001 was generally well tolerated when administered monthly for a year or more. INFRONT-2 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results The open-label study was designed to assess safety and tolerability of chronic dosing of AL001, as well as gathering data related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, exploratory biomarkers of pharmacologic activity and efficacy. INFRONT-2 included three cohorts of FTD patients: asymptomatic FTD-GRN mutation carriers, symptomatic FTD-GRN patients, and FTD-C9orf72 patients. Data presented today during the Oral Communications session at CTAD focused on the symptomatic FTD-GRN cohort and included 12-month data for up to twelve patients who received 60 mg/kg of AL001 every four weeks. As of the data cut, ten FTD-GRN patients had completed twelve months of treatment, and data presented today include those study participants (at least 9) who were able to complete all assessments. Overall, AL001 was well tolerated in the Phase 2 study. Twenty-seven study participants from all three cohorts of the INFRONT-2 trial were assessed for safety. Fifteen of the 27 reported mild adverse events (AEs), and three participants experienced serious AEs but none of the serious AEs reported were attributed to treatment. AL001 treatment of symptomatic FTD-GRN patients resulted in rapid and sustained increases in progranulin whether measured in the plasma or CSF. Mean progranulin levels doubled from baseline and achieved normal levels comparable to those of an age-matched procured control group. Changes in biomarkers from baseline to 12-months suggest that AL001 restores normal lysosome and complement function in FTD-GRN patients. Over the course of treatment with AL001, biomarkers of lysosomal function (CTSD and LAMP1) and complement activation (C1QB), which were elevated in FTD-GRN patients at baseline decreased to levels comparable to an age-matched control group. Mean levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) remained stable over the course of AL001 treatment in both plasma and CSF. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the adult central nervous system. When injury or disease are present, astrocytes become reactive (known as astrogliosis) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels increase. GFAP has been identified as a prognostic marker in FTD patients(2), and elevated levels have been associated with disease severity. In the INFRONT-2 Phase 2 study, symptomatic FTD-GRN patients showed elevated levels of GFAP at baseline, and over the course of treatment with AL001, GFAP levels decreased to be within the range of an asymptomatic FTD-GRN cohort. In order to provide context for the clinical outcome observed in the open-label INFRONT-2 study, a matched control cohort of FTD-GRN participants from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI2) was created using propensity score matching. A total of ten GENFI2 patients were identified whose baseline cognitive assessment scores and characteristics were comparable to those of participants in the symptomatic cohort of the AL001 Phase 2. Researchers were blinded to the one-year follow-up data from the GENFI matched control cohort. Cognitive assessment was measured using the CDR® plus NACC FTLD-SB scale, a standard FTD clinical rating instrument that assesses cognitive, functional, behavioral and language impairments over time. The CDR® plus NACC FTLD-SB scores in the GENFI2 matched control group had a projected annual increase of 6.4 points from baseline over one year. By comparison, the projected annual increase in the AL001 cohort (N=12) was estimated at 3.3 points over one year, representing a 48 percent decrease in the rate of clinical progression for patients treated with AL001... https://investors.alector.com/node/8281/pdf; July 29, 2021 [Press release, Interim Results] Alector Presents 12-Month Results from the INFRONT-2 Phase II Open-label Clinical Study of AL001 for the Treatment of Symptomatic Frontotemporal Dementia Patients with a Progranulin Mutation - AL001 Successfully Restored Progranulin to Normal Levels in FTD-GRN Patients - Treatment with AL001 Slowed Clinical Progression by 47% Based on the CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB Scale Relative to GENFI2 Matched Control Cohort - Consistent Trends toward Normalization or Stabilization in Multiple Disease Biomarkers Observed with AL001 Treatment DENVER, July 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alector, Inc...presented promising results from the company’s INFRONT-2 Phase II clinical trial of AL001 at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC 2021)...

AL001 showed favorable safety profile and rapidly restored progranulin levels to normal ranges in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the duration of treatment. While the INFRONT-2 Phase II study was not designed to demonstrate clinical benefit, clinical outcome assessments using the CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scale found that AL001 treatment slowed clinical progression by 47% compared to a matched control cohort of participants from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI2)(1).Additionally, multiple disease-relevant biomarkers of lysosomal function, complement activation and neuronal health trended toward normalization or remained stable... ...INFRONT-2 Phase II Clinical Trial Results The open-label INFRONT-2 Phase II study was designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of chronic dosing of AL001 over 96 weeks. INFRONT-2 included three cohorts of FTD patients: asymptomatic FTD-GRN patients, symptomatic FTD-GRN patients and FTD-C9orf72 patients. Biomarker and clinical results presented today focused on the symptomatic FTD-GRN cohort and included 12-month data for up to twelve patients who received 60mg/kg of AL001 every four weeks. As of the data cut, nine FTD-GRN patients had completed twelve months of treatment, and between seven and nine patients were able to complete all assessments. Safety data was reported across all three cohorts (N=27) who received a median of 15 doses of AL001. AL001 showed a favorable safety profile in the Phase II study. Six of the 27 patients reported mild treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs observed on study in more than two patients were falls (5/27, 18.5%) and rash (3/27, 11.1%). Three patients in the FTD-GRN cohort experienced serious AEs, but none of these were attributed to treatment with AL001. Among the symptomatic FTD-GRN cohort, AL001 treatment resulted in rapid and sustained 2-2.5-fold elevations of progranulin comparable to normal levels from an age-matched procured control group of healthy volunteers. [Refer to source URL for tabular data] Representative biomarkers associated with progranulin deficiencies measuring lysosomal function (CTSD and LAMP1) and complement activation (C1QB) were elevated in FTD-GRN patients at baseline compared to an age-matched procured control group, indicative of a disease state. AL001 treatment resulted in a time-dependent and durable decreases over twelve months to levels seen in age-matched controls, suggesting that AL001 restores normal lysosome and complement function in these patients. Neuronal degeneration was assessed by measuring neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the plasma and CSF, and by measuring brain atrophy via volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI). NfL showed within-patient variability in patients and over time, with mean levels stable at 49 weeks compared to baseline. [Refer to source URL for tabular data] Volume changes of the whole brain, the frontotemporal cortex and the ventricles were measured over one year and compared to a matched control cohort (N=7) developed from participants in the GENFI2 patient registry. Treatment with AL001 resulted in a greater than 10% difference in the atrophy rates in favor of AL001 for the whole brain and frontotemporal cortex measures, and an approximately 50% reduction in ventricular enlargement. [Refer to source URL for tabular data] The potential clinical benefit of AL001 in FTD-GRN patients was measured using the CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scale, a standard FTD clinical rating instrument that assesses cognitive, functional, behavioral and language impairments over time, and which is also the primary endpoint of Alector’s ongoing Phase III study of AL001 for the treatment of FTD-GRN. Treatment with AL001 showed a 47% slowing of clinical progression among the INFRONT-2 patients relative to matched GENFI2 controls. The CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB scores in the GENFI2 matched control group (N=10), showed an annual increase of 6.4 points from baseline over one year, indicating rapid disease progression.

Results: In a mouse model of FTD-GRN, the rodent cross-reactive anti-sortilin antibody, S15JG, decreased total sortilin levels in white blood cell (WBC) lysates, restored PGRN to normal levels in plasma, and rescued a behavioral deficit. In cynomolgus monkeys, latozinemab decreased sortilin levels in WBCs and concomitantly increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PGRN by 2- to threefold. Finally, in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, a single infusion of latozinemab caused a reduction in WBC sortilin, tripled plasma PGRN and doubled CSF PGRN in healthy volunteers, and restored PGRN to physiological levels in asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers.

(Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, today announced preliminary data from its Phase 1b and open-label Phase 2 studies of AL001, for the treatment of people with frontotemporal dementia with a progranulin gene (GRN) mutation (FTD-GRN). AL001 is the company’s wholly owned, investigational human monoclonal antibody designed to modulate progranulin, a key regulator of immune activity in the brain. The data were presented today at the virtual 2020 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) by Robert Paul, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Alector. https://investors.alector.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alector-announces-promising-preliminary-data-al001-phase-1b-and; July 27, 2020 Presented at the Alzheimer's Association Virtual International Conference (AAIC), July 27-31, 2020, Amsterdam, Netherlands Online published date: July 27, 2020 Abstract No.: SCR3-19-03 Beth Ann Haynes, Herve Rhinn, Felix L Yeh, Hua Long, Michael Ward, Mackenzie Hagey, Omer Siddiqui, Robert Paul AL001 Restores CSF PGRN Levels and Normalizes Disease-Associated Biomarkers in Individuals with Frontotemporal Dementia due to Heterozygous Mutations in the Progranulin Gene. Result: Treatment of symptomatic FTD-GRN participants with AL001 over 4 weeks restored PGRN levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to normal levels for more than 8 weeks. To further investigate the effects of restoring PGRN levels, partial normalization of a FTD disease proteomic signature was observed in the CSF 4 weeks after the last dose in multidose treatment group. Compared to healthy volunteers, AL001 treatment rescued cathepsin B (CTSB), a marker of lysosomal function, by 58%. AL001 treatment also partially normalized markers of inflammation and gliosis, osteopontin (SPP1) and chitotriosidase (CHIT1) by 52% and 22%, respectively. In addition to the reversal of these disease phenotypes, a 14% reduction (n.s.) in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neuron injury and stress, was observed after 8 weeks after the last dose. Conclusion: AL001 treatment resulted in a sustained increase in plasma and CSF PGRN in FTD-GRN mutation carriers. New data showed reduction of NfL and normalization of proteins associated with the disease after one month of dosing.

Bossolasco, C. Morelli, F. Servida, C. Lunetta, F. Onida, S. Argenton, M. Corbo, G. Lambertenghi Deliliers, V. Silani Presence of CD34+ cells in the CSF after G-CSF induced mobilisation and mannitol treatment in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Results: Successful mobilization in the PB was achieved in all the patients, with CD34+ cell count significantly increased after G-CSF administration. Conversely, the number of cells in the CSF augmented only when mannitol administration was associated to the G-CSF mobilization. An increase in the concentration of G-CSF was observed both in the PB and CSF of all patients, independently of mannitol administration. One tracheotomised patient presented an acute respiratory distress syndrome with favourable evolution. All patients referred a mild but transient improvement of motor performance. Conclusions: We observed that G-CSF administration was relatively safe and tolerable in ALS patients. We demonstrated that SCs need mannitol to pass BBB after mobilization with G-CSF. Instead, G-CSF crossed BBB without restrictions. The transient positive clinical effect may be due to different cell types, including mobilized CD34+ cells co-expressing the neural progenitor antigen CD133. http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=130445&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=140&XNMASKEN_ID=900; November 02, 2009 Cytotherapy. 2009 Nov 2.

Results: Twenty patients completed the four-course schedule. One patient died and one refused to continue the program before starting the mobilization courses; four discontinued the study protocol because of disease progression. Overall, 89 G-CSF courses were delivered. There were two severe adverse events: one prolactinoma and one deep vein thrombosis. There were no discontinuations as a result of toxic complications. Circulating CD34(+) cells were monitored during 85 G-CSF courses and were always markedly increased; the range of median peak values was 41-57/muL, with no significant differences among the four G-CSF courses. Circulating clonogenic progenitor levels paralleled CD34(+) cell levels. Most mobilized CD34(+) cells co-expressed stem cell markers, with a significant increase in CD133 co-expression. Conclusions: It is feasible to deliver repeated courses of G-CSF to mobilize a substantial number of CD34(+) cells in patients with ALS; mobilized BMC include immature cells with potential clinical usefulness. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878077?dopt=Abstract http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14653240903300682; April 30, 2009 Presented at the 61th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 25 - May 2, 2009, Seattle, WA Abstract no.

A comparable hematological response was observed at each of the four cycles of treatment. CD34+ cells were found in CSF of 3 patients. The only adverse effects were a transient increase of growth hormone level (1 patient), and a deep venous thrombosis (1 patient). Two patients deceased and four were tracheostomized. Comparing the run-in and the treatment period a reduction of ALS-FRS-R score decrease (from 1.45 points/month to 1.15 points/month) and a of FVC decrease (from 2.61/month to 1.91/month) was found. Conclusions/Relevance: This trial indicates that G-CSF use to induce BMCs mobilization is safe, well tolerated, and feasible in ALS; BMCs mobilization in ALS parallels that commonly observed in the healthy population; a trend to a reduction of the rate of progression of ALS-FRS-R and FVC has been found when the pretreatment and the treatment periods are compared. A placebo-controlled trial is required to verify possible benefits of the repeated BMC mobilization in ALS.

The study reports a pharmacokinetic analysis of the relationship between treatment dose, blood levels and pharmacological activity of the drug hydromethylthionine on the brain in 176 patients with bvFTD. The results showed that, even at the lowest dose of hydromethylthionine tested (8 mg/day), the drug (taken as a tablet) produced statistically significant concentration-dependent effects on clinical decline and brain atrophy with results similar to those reported recently in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)... ...Hydromethylthionine blocks abnormal aggregation in the brain of the proteins linked to over 80% of bvFTD (tau protein and TDP-43 protein). A global Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in 220 patients meeting international consensus criteria for a diagnosis of bvFTD1 who also had definite evidence of brain atrophy on their brain scan. Hydromethylthionine was tested at doses of 200 mg/day against a low dose of 8 mg/day which was intended only as a control to mask the discolouration of urine that can sometimes occur with the drug. The study design was based on the findings from an earlier trial in AD that used a different variant of the drug.2As in the recently reported hydromethylthionine trials in AD, there was no difference between the high dose and the low dose on any of the clinical outcomes in the trial. To explore these results further, the researchers conducted a pharmacokinetic population analysis using plasma concentration data from patients who participated in the trial to measure how blood levels of the drug relate to its effects on the brain. Of the 220 patients initially randomised to the trial, blood samples and outcome data at baseline and at 12 months were available for 176. Using a new assay, the researchers found that the effects of hydromethylthionine at the 8 mg/day dose were determined by the blood level, and that the majority of patients had high enough blood levels of the drug even at this low dose to reduce clinical decline and brain atrophy by about half over 12 months compared to those with minimal blood levels. The high dose of 200 mg/day gave no additional benefit. The analyses suggest that a dose of about 30 mg/day would be optimal for treating bvFTD and could reduce the rate of disease progression even more. TauRx now plans to test this dose in a placebo-controlled confirmatory trial. The analysis also showed that the concentration-response profile in bvFTD is similar to that recently reported in AD.5 Disease progression is linked to abnormal aggregation of Tau and TDP-43 proteins inside nerve cells in the brain in both diseases. The present results support the idea that hydromethylthionine works in a similar way in both AD and bvFTD... ...About the Study This study reports the results of a global Phase 3 trial in 220 patients with bvFTD conducted between 2013 and 2016 at 70 sites in 13 countries (Canada, United States, Australia, Asia, Europe). Patients had to be younger than 80 years of age and have a diagnosis bvFTD according to criteria revised by the International bvFTD Criteria Consortium1 with Mini-mental Status Examination score greater than or equal to 20 at screening. Patients were randomly assigned to receive hydromethylthionine at doses of 200 or 8 mg/day. The validated lower limit of quantification of the pharmacokinetic assay was 0.20 ng/mL, corresponding to an estimated steady-state peak plasma concentration of 0.346 ng/mL in bvFTD patients. About 35% of patients taking the 8 mg/day dose had plasma concentrations below this level... https://taurx.com/uploads/press%20releases/JAD%20press%20release%20bvFTD_19May2020.pdf; April 8, 2020 J Alzheimers Dis. 2020 Apr 8. doi: 10.3233/JAD-191173 Accepted 4 March 2020 | Published: 08 April 2020 Helen Shiells, Bjoern O Schelter, Peter Bentham, Thomas C Baddeley , Christopher M Rubino, Harish Ganesan, Jeffrey Hammel, Vesna Vuksanovic, Roger T Staff, Alison D Murray, Luc Bracoud, Damon J Wischik, Gernot Riedel, Serge Gauthier, Jianping Jia, Hans J Moebius, Jiri Hardlund, Christopher M Kipps, Karin Kook, John M D Storey, Charles R Harrington, Claude M Wischik Concentration-Dependent Activity of Hydromethylthionine on Clinical Decline and Brain Atrophy in a Randomized Controlled Trial in Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia Results: There were no significant differences between the two doses as randomized. There were steep concentration-response relationships for plasma levels in the range 0.3-0.6 ng/ml at the 8 mg/day dose on clinical and MRI outcomes. There were significant exposure-dependent differences at 8 mg/day for FAQ, Modified-CGIC, and whole brain atrophy comparing patients with plasma levels greater than 0.346 ng/ml with having minimal drug exposure. The exposure-response is biphasic with worse outcomes at the high concentrations produced by 200 mg/day. Conclusions: Hydromethylthionine has a similar concentration-response profile for effects on clinical decline and brain atrophy at the 8 mg/day dose in bvFTD as recently reported in AD. Treatment responses in bvFTD are predicted to be maximal at doses in the range 20-60 mg/day.

Shiells, B.O. Schelter, S. Gauthier, C.M. Wischik Concentration-Dependent Reduction In Clinical Decline And Brain Atrophy In A Phase 3 Trial Of Leuco-Methylthioninium Bis(Hydromethanesulphonate) (LMTM) In Behaviourial Variant Front Temporal Dementia Results: Patients in this study had significantly more atrophy in frontal cortex and anterior temporal cortex, and significantly less atrophy in hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, cuneus and insula compared with mild AD patients. As randomised, there were no significant differences between the two doses tested on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. However, the population PK analysis revealed consistent concentrationresponse relationships for all outcomes. Compared against the 35% of patients with plasma levels below the validated limit of quantitation of the assay on Day 1 (steady state plasma levels below 0.346 ng/ml), the treatment differences for patients with therapeutic levels at the 8 mg/day dose were 5.1 units (p = 0.0536, 45% reduction) on the ACE-R scale, -3.3 units (p = 0.0131, 46% reduction) on the FAQ scale, and 11.7 cm3 (p = 0.0006, 42% reduction) in whole brain atrophy. Outcomes were worse at 200 mg/day, consistent with a biphasic concentration-response profile. Decline on the ACE-R and FAQ scales in patients with subtherapeutic exposure was comparable to historical studies. The withdrawal rate over 12 months was lower at 8 mg/day (15%) than at 200 mg/day (38%). Conclusions: The treatment effects of LMTM in bvFTD may be determined by plasma concentration. The minimum effective dose is 8 mg/day for most patients and doses in the range 20 – 40 mg/day are predicted to provide maximal benefit. LMTM has an acceptable safety profile and is well tolerated. The results are essentially identical to those obtained in the AD studies conducted in parallel, implying that shared underlying protein aggregation pathophysiology can be modified in both diseases by LMTM. Although these post hoc results come from non-randomised population PK analyses, they support the potential use of LMTM for treatment of bvFTD. A further placebo-controlled study is now planned to confirm the efficacy of LMTM at a dose of 20 mg/day.

[Epub ahead of print] Open-label pilot trial of levetiracetam for cramps and spasticity in patients with motor neuron disease. Results: Cramp and spasticity scores were stable over a 3-month baseline. Shortly after starting levetiracetam, there was a significant reduction in cramp severity and frequency, which persisted for the duration of this year-long study. There was also a reduction in phasic but not tonic spasticity. Levetiracetam was well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results justify a placebo-controlled study of levetiracetam for treatment of cramps and spasticity in patients with motor neuron diseases, and suggest that this can be accomplished with a small number of subjects followed for a short time. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18821142?dopt=abstract; December 1, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Bedlack R, Hawes J, Pastula D, Heydt D, Burke P Poster No.: P135 A pilot trial of levetiracetam for cramps, spasticity and neuroprotection in patients with motor neuron diseases Results: Enrollment began May 2006 and 21 patients have now passed screening. Prior to starting the trial, one patient recalled prior treatment with Levetiracetam and was thus disqualified. The last patient enrolled in November 2006. In terms of demographics, there are 10 males and 10 females. Ages range from 38 to 78. There is 1 non-white subject. ALS, PLS and PMA are all represented. Thus far Levetiracetam appears safe and well tolerated. There have been 4 serious adverse events: appendicitis, PEG tube infection, severe dehydration due to diarrhea and urinary tract infection, and death. None of these were considered related to drug. Non-serious adverse events are consistent with those seen in prior studies of Levetiracetam. In most patients, cramp scores have been stable during the baseline period. In some, there is a decrease in cramp scores coincident with starting Levetiracetam. Discussion: The results of this study will impact the design of future studies using similar outcome measures. If Levetiracetam continues to appear safe and tolerable, and is associated with an improvement in any study outcome measures, a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial will start in 2008 http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925","Secondary Outcome Measures Cramps scores, spasticity scores, FVC, ALSFRS, MMT.

Secondary Outcome Measures : Disease Progression [ Time Frame: From Baseline through study completion(subject's last visit, 2-48 weeks after study entry) ] Count of study withdrawals due to disease progression Supine Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) [ Time Frame: The change from Baseline, week 2, week 4, month 3, month 6, end-of-study (subject's last visit, 2-48 weeks after study entry) ] Change from baseline in supine and sitting SVC (all devices) through to the end of the study, expressed as a % of predicted normal Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) [ Time Frame: Change from Baseline in respiratory function of ALSFRS-R at study completion (subject's last visit, 2-48 weeks after study entry) ] ALSFRS-R scale contains 3 parameters related to respiratory function: Severity of dyspnea, occurrence of orthopnea (shortness of breath when in supine position i.e. lying flat), and the use of mechanical ventilation for respiratory in sufficiency. These 3 parameters are combined to create the respiratory domain with a score of 0-12(where 12 is normal function). Although individual items and patients vary, ALSFRS-R typically declines at a relatively constant rate over time. Plotted over time the slope of the line obtained indicates the speed of progression and thus an effective treatment might be expected ro reduce the slope of decline.

The scale ranges from 0(no dysponea) to 10 (maximal dyspnea). each category is numbered and most but not all have verbal cues. At each assessment the patient scored the category they felt best described their symptoms. The analysis measured change from baseline to the end of the study in both a supine and sitting position where a negative score indicates improvement and a positive score reflects worsening.

Published:October, 2021 Safety and efficacy of oral levosimendan in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (the REFALS study): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial Prof Merit Cudkowicz, MD, Angela Genge, MD, Prof Nicholas Maragakis, MD, Prof Susanne Petri, MD, Prof Leonard van den Berg, MD, Valtteri V Aho, MD, Toni Sarapohja, MSc, Mikko Kuoppamäki, MD, Chris Garratt, MBChB, Prof Ammar Al-Chalabi, FRCP, on behalf of theREFALS investigators. Findings: Between June 21, 2018, and June 28, 2019, 871 people were screened for the study, of whom 496 were randomly assigned either levosimendan (n=329) or placebo (n=167). Participants were followed up between June 27, 2018 and June 26, 2020, for a median duration of 50·1 (IQR 37·5-51·1) weeks. The median duration of treatment was 47·9 (IQR 26·4-48·1) weeks. Change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks was -6·73% with levosimendan and -6·99% with placebo, with no significant difference between the treatments (estimated treatment difference 0·26%, 95% CI -2·03 to 2·55, p=0·83). Similarly, at week 48, CAFS did not differ between treatment groups (least squares mean change from baseline 10·69, 95% CI -15·74 to 37·12; nominal p value=0·43). The most frequent adverse events were increased heart rate (106 [33%] of 326 receiving levosimendan vs 12 [7%] of 166 receiving placebo), fall (85 [26%] vs 48 [29%]), headache (93 [29%] vs 36 [22%]), and dyspnoea (59 [18%] vs 32 [19%]). 33 (10%) participants allocated levosimendan and 20 (12%) assigned placebo died during the trial, mainly due to respiratory failure or progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Interpretation: Levosimendan was not superior to placebo in maintaining respiratory function in a broad population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although levosimendan was generally well tolerated, increased heart rate and headache occurred more frequently with levosimendan than with placebo. The possibility of a clinically relevant subgroup of responsive individuals requires further evaluation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536404/ https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00242-8/fulltext; August 31, 2021 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: August 31, 2021 Last Update Posted: August 31, 2021 Recruitment Details: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were recruited.

The primary endpoint of the trial was to show a statistically significant difference between levosimendan and placebo in slow vital capacity (SVC) in supine position at 12 weeks compared to the baseline. An important secondary endpoint was to show a statistically significant difference between levosimendan and placebo in patient functionality measured by ALSFRS-R Scale (Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale) in combination with survival at 48 weeks compared to the baseline. These pre-specified endpoints were not met in the trial. No new safety concerns were identified for levosimendan in this study. The REFALS phase 3 trial data will be presented at a future scientific meeting. https://www.orion.fi/en/Orion-group/media/stock-exchange-releases/2020/orions-phase-3-refals-trial-evaluating-the-efficacy-of-oral-levosimendan-in-treatment-of-als-patients-did-not-reach-its-pre-specified-endpoints/?epieditmode=true","The secondary objective is to confirm that levosimendan improves the functionality of subjects, measured by Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The latter two are sleep scales assessing daytime somnolence and sleep quality, respectively. In addition, the long-term tolerability and safety of levosimendan in ALS patients will be evaluated, assessing up to 48 weeks of exposure. Secondary end point(s): Secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in following hierarchy to preserve the overall alpha level: Combined assessment of ALSFRS-R function and survival through 48 weeks Time to respiratory event trough 48 weeks CGI at 48 weeks Change from baseline in respiratory function of ALSFRS-R at 48 weeks The efficacy variables time to respiratory event, time to NIV or death, time to SVC (supine) decline of 20%, time to ALSFRS-R total score decline of 20% and time to decline in ALSFRS-R respiratory domain will be evaluated. Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The total duration for double-blind comparison will be 48 weeks. Interim/futility analyses will be done when approximately 50% and 100% of the subjects have been treated for 12 weeks. Secondary Outcome Measures : Combined Assessment of Function and Survival Through 48 Weeks [ Time Frame: Mean rank at 48 weeks ] Scale: The ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised. This scale includes 12 items. Each item was scored from 0 to 4. Total score is the sum of the scores of all 12 items. Each subject is ranked according to time-to-death (earlier deaths ranked lower than later deaths). Subjects who survive are ranked more favorably than subjects who died. Among the survivors, subjects are ranked according to change in ALSFRS-R (greater worsening of ALSFRS-R is ranked lower than after deaths). Subjects who survive are ranked more favorably than subjects who died. Among the survivors, subjects are ranked according to change in ALSFRS-R (greater worsening of ALSFRS-R is ranked lower than less worsening or an improvement in ALSFRS-R). The ranked scores range from 001 to 496 (the number of participants assessed for the Outcome Measure) with larger rank score numbers associated with a better outcome. Time to Respiratory Event Through 48 Weeks [ Time Frame: Time to event through 48 weeks ] ALSFRS-R scale contains 3 items that relate to respiratory function: severity of dyspnoea, occurrence of orthopnoea (shortness of breath when lying flat) and the use of mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. A reduction in any one of these items was considered a respiratory event. Not all patients receive ventilatory support, despite respiratory insufficiency: meeting ""protocolised"" criteria for NIV relates to patients without NIV whose slow vital capacity declined to a level that would ordinarily trigger such treatment. Change From the Baseline in Clinical Global Impression CGI at 48 Weeks [ Time Frame: The change from baseline at 48 weeks ] Visual Analogue Scale 0-100 millimeters, rated by study subjects. Score 0 indicates that the subject is completely well without any disability and score 100 indicates the worst possible severity of the condition. Change From Baseline in Respiratory Function of ALSFRS-R at 48 Weeks [ Time Frame: Slope of decline at 48 weeks ] ALSFRS-R scale contains 3 items that relate to respiratory function: severity of dyspnoea, occurrence of orthopnoea (shortness of breath when lying flat) and the use of mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. These are added together to created the respiratory domain with a score range 0-12 (where 12 represents normal function). Although individual items and patients vary, ALSFRS-R typically declines at a relatively constant rate over time. Plotted over time the slope of the line obtained indicates the speed of progression and thus an effective treatment might be expected to reduce the slope of decline. Supine Borg Category Ratio 10 Scale at 12 Weeks [ Time Frame: Change from baseline at 12 weeks ] Patients rated their perception of the severity of their dysnoea using the Borg scale. The scale ranges from 0 (no dyspnoea) to 10 (maximal). Each category is numbered and most (not all) have verbal cues. At each assessment the patient scored the category they felt best described their symptoms. The analysis measured change from baseline at 12 weeks, where a negative score indicates improvement and a positive score reflects worsening. Borg scale for dyspnoea. while secondary endpoints include the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) adjusted for patient survival, the occurrence ofb respiratory events, clinical global impression, Borg scale for dyspnoea and scales assessing sleep and sleepiness. Secondary endpoints include ALSFRS-R adjusted for patient survival (CAFS), the occurrence of respiratory events, clinical global impression, Borg scale for dyspnoea and scales assessing sleep and sleepiness. The safety profile of oral levosimendan was assessed using standard measures including adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory safety tests at regular intervals throughout the 48-week treatment period.

Slow Vital Capacity,0,"December 9, 2019 [ Additional Analysis] Orion presented data on oral levosimendan at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND ..Biomarker analysis in oral levosimendan phase 2 clinical trial LEVALS (poster BIO-11) To investigate further the effect of levosimendan in ALS patients and to understand disease progression, clinical chemistry measurements and exploratory biomarkers from patients in the 6 month open-label extension of the LEVALS study were analysed. Kira M. Holmström, PhD, senior scientist, Orion Corporation, presented data on selected biomarkers, including markers for muscle wasting, creatine kinase and creatinine, the energy metabolism enzyme and tissue damage indicator lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver function related enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and albumin. These markers have also been suggested to reflect level of oxidative stress. Exploratory biomarkers included the neuronal damage indicator neurofilament light chain (NFL) and inflammatory biomarkers, such as angiogenin. A number of laboratory variables, collected routinely to monitor safety in the LEVALS study, demonstrated changes over time that may reflect progression of ALS. Such routine markers may have additional value in managing patients with ALS and in future clinical trials. “We are excited to explore potential biomarkers in ALS to contribute to the knowledge of the disease progression, and to ultimately understand how such marker could be used for better and more targeted treatment of patients with ALS”, said Christer Nordstedt, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, R&D, Orion Corporation. https://www.orion.fi/en/Orion-group/media/press-releases/2019/orion-presented-data-on-oral-levosimendan-at-the-30th-international-symposium-on-alsmnd/?epieditmode=true https://www.orion.fi/globalassets/documents/rd/congress-posters/odm109/als_mnd-4-biomarker-poster-print.pdf; November 8, 2019 [Pooled Results] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 20, Issue supplement 1, November 2019 Presented at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 4-6, 2019, Perth, Australia Online published date: November 8, 2019 Abstract No.: CLT-26 Tuula Ahtola-Sätilä, Toni Sarapohja, Valtteri V. Aho, Matti Kivikko Oral Levosimendan For Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Pharmacokinetic Considerations Results: After oral administration, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of levosimendan in plasma was seen after 1 hour. Absorption of levosimendan was directly proportional to the oral dose. The circulating metabolites OR-1855 and OR-1896 were formed and eliminated slowly. Their steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) were reached approximately 13-14 days after start of oral levosimendan administration and were directly proportional to the daily oral dose. No accumulation of the metabolites occurred with constant 1 mg or 2 mg daily dose of oral levosimendan for 180 days. The mean Css of the metabolites in patients with ALS and with chronic heart failure were similar and somewhat higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Discussion and conclusions: The plasma concentrations of the parent drug levosimendan and those of its metabolites increase dose-proportionally. With constant oral daily dosing the steady state plasma concentration of the active metabolite, OR-1896, is reached in two weeks; no accumulation thereafter is noted even with prolonged treatment up to 180 days.

Holmström, on behalf of the LEVALS study group, Biomarker analysis in oral levosimendan phase 2 clinical trial LEVALS Results: A significant decrease in the muscle biomarker creatinine (also a marker for kidney injury) (p < 0.0001) was observed over time. Furthermore, levels of another muscle marker, creatine kinase, correlated with the ALSFRS-R (r = 0.42, p = 0.0134) as well as SVC sitting (r = 0.43, p = 0.0096) and supine (r = 0.50, p = 0.0020). Changes in energy metabolism enzyme and tissue damage indicator lactate dehydrogenase also correlated with the ALSFRS-R (r = 0.44, p = 0.0098), while liver function related enzymes alkaline phosphatase (r = –0,42, p = 0.0114), albumin (r = 0.37, p = 0.028) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (r = –0.39, p = 0.0221) were associated with SVC sitting scores. These markers have also been suggested to reflect level of oxidative stress. Comparisons to the PRO-ACT ‘pla- cebo’ cohort showed interesting trends towards an improve- ment in levosimendan treated patients in various biomarkers. Results on exploratory biomarkers, such as neurofilaments and inflammatory proteins, will also be presented.

Sitting SVC was not significantly different between the treatments. In post hoc analysis using period-wise baselines, supine SVC favoured levosimendan over placebo, estimated mean differences from baseline being -3.62% on placebo, +0.77% on levosimendan 1?mg daily (p=0.018) and +2.38% on 1?mg two times a day (p=0.001). Headache occurred in 16.7% of patients during levosimendan 1?mg daily (p=0.030), 28.6% during 1?mg two times a day (p=0.002) and 3.3% during placebo. The respective frequencies for increased heart rate were 5.1% (p=0.337), 18.5% (p=0.018) and 1.7%. No significant differences between the treatments were seen for other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan did not achieve the primary endpoint of improving sitting SVC in ALS. Headache and increased heart rate were increased on levosimendan, although it was otherwise well tolerated. A phase III study to evaluate the longer term effects of oral levosimendan in ALS is ongoing. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315908 [Below are full text links] https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/90/10/1165.long https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/90/10/1165.full.pdf; November 7, 2017 Amyotrophic and Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 18, S2, Pages 1-337, Published online: 7 Nov 2017 Presented at the 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2017, Boston, MA Abstract No. CLT-18 A Al-Chalabi, P Shaw, PN Leigh, L van den Berg, O Hardiman, A Ludolph, T Sarapohja, M Kuoppamaki; Oral levosimendan (ODM-109): key placebo-controlled results from the phase 2 study in ALS patients with SVC between 60-90% predicted at screening. Results: 66 patients were randomized into the study. A total of 59 patients contributed to the double-blind results and 50 of them completed all three treatment periods. The primary efficacy variable was SVC% (sitting). In contrast to assumptions, there was a clear period effect in the data. Therefore, period-wise baselines were justified in efficacy variable analyses (post-hoc). The estimated mean differences from baseline were 0.67, -0.98 and -0.01% points for placebo, levosimendan 1 mg daily (p = 0.97 vs placebo) and levosimendan 2 mg daily (p = 0.85 vs placebo), respectively. For the secondary efficacy variable of SVC% (supine), the estimated mean differences from baseline were -3.62, +0.77 and +2.38% points for placebo, levosimendan 1 mg daily (p = 0.018 vs placebo) and levosimendan 2 mg daily (p = 0.001 vs placebo), respectively. In other words, both levosimendan doses improved SVC% (supine) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SVC% (supine) decreased during placebo. Both levosimendan doses were also numerically better compared to placebo in ALSFRS-R total score and respiratory domain scores. Levosimendan was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) reported as related to levosimendan were headache (due to vasodilatation) and increase in heart rate, both of which showed a dose-dependent increase in frequency. While most of the premature discontinuations without subjective symptoms were due to the study medication stopping rule related to an increase in mean heart rate in 24-hour Holter recording, headache led to discontinuation in one subject. The number of severe AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias were similar between placebo and levosimendan treatments. Discussion and conclusions: Although the primary efficacy variable did not find differences between the treatments, there was a promising signal in SVC measured in supine position warranting further studies with oral levosimendan in ALS.

Bresolin, G.P. Comi (Milan, IT) Decline of ALS-FRS and Norris Scale Scores in a Group of Patients Affected by ALS and Treated with Lithium Results: Seventeen patients were evaluated for the study but 5 were excluded due to contraindications to lithium therapy. The remaining 12 patients (66.67% males) were treated, their mean age was 60.67 years old (y.o.; C.I. 6.07, p<0.05). One patient had mostly upper MN signs, 5 mostly lower MN signs and 6 had the classic ALS form. Mean age of onset was 55.5 y.o. (C.I. 6.29, p<0.05). Mean disease duration was 5.17 years (C.I. 1.77, p<0.05). Mean ALS-FRS-40 score at the start of the study was 30.83 (C.I. 2.55, p<0.05), mean Norris Scale score was 80.5 (C.I. 4.76, p<0.05). Mean ALS-FRS-40 score at the end of the study was 25.42 (C.I. 3.16, p<0.05), mean Norris Scale score was 71 (C.I. 6.17, p<0.05). Mean progression rate for ALS-FRS-40 score was 0.9/month (C.I. 0.5, p<0.05), for Norris scale score 1.18/month (C.I. 0.54, p<0.05). No patient died during the study, neither anyone needed tracheostomy or full-time assisted ventilation. Only the patient with mostly first MN signs had no worsening of the ALS-FRS-40 (27, from start to end). No severe adverse events was recorded during the study. Conclusion: Treatment of ALS with lithium does not appear to effectively and significantly delay disease progression in a small cohort of patients. A major difference with the previous observational study is the longer disease duration at the beginning of the treatment, that may have contributed to the lack of disease stabilization Page (81 of 266) http://www.springerlink.com/content/m6115p12117m8868/fulltext.pdf http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=91108&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=97&XNMASKEN_ID=900",Secondary Outcome Measures: Rate of deterioration of function assessed by the Norris scale and the ALS Functional Rating Scale 40.,TrialTroveID-111182,"Primary Outcome Measures: Survival, time to death, tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation.",,,111182,,,,Ii,,1,0,1,0,5,0,7,SURVIVAL,0,0,0,0

Lack of efficacy in a dose-finding trial. Results: As of October 2009, a total of 171 patients had been enrolled, 87 randomized to the TG and 84 to the STG. The interim data analysis, performed per protocol, showed that 117 patients (68.4%) discontinued the study because of death/tracheotomy/severe disability, adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs), or lack of efficacy. The Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial on November 2, 2009. Conclusions: Lithium was not well-tolerated in this cohort of patients with ALS, even at subtherapeutic doses. The 2 doses were equivalent in terms of survival/severe disability and functional data. The relatively high frequency of AEs/SAEs and the reduced tolerability of lithium raised serious doubts about its safety in ALS. Classification of evidence: The study provides Class II evidence that therapeutic (0.4-0.8 mEq/L) vs subtherapeutic (0.2-0.4 mEq/L) lithium carbonate did not differ in the primary outcome of efficacy (survival/loss of autonomy) in ALS. Both target levels led to dropouts in more than 30% of participants due to patient-perceived lack of efficacy and AEs. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702794 http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/75/7/619; April 13, 2010 Presented at 62nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 10-17, 2010, Toronto, Canada Abstract no.

Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in both TD and STD groups. At the scheduled interim analysis, the safety committee decided to stop the trial, because 102 patients (60%) had discontinued the study (37 due to death/tracheostomy; 34 due to severe adverse events, and 31 to discontinuation of trial medication). Lithium carbonate was particularly harmful in patients with FVC 80% at the time of randomization. At the time of the interruption, patients' survival, SAE and AE were similar in both TD and STD groups. The mean monthly decrease of ALS-FRS-R score was lower, albeit not significantly, in the STD group. Conclusion: Lithium carbonate at the target plasma level of 0.4-0.8 mEq/L was not better than a lower, sub-therapeutical, dose in term of survival and rate of progression of ALSFRS-R. Sixty percent of patients discontinued the study. Lithium carbonate did not demonstrate any beneficial effect in ALS and was potentially harmful, in particular in patients with respiratory disturbances. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_S16.001",Secondary objectives: Evaluation of the drug tolerability and safety,EudraCT Number: 2008-001094-15 LitALS TrialTroveID-108793,"Death or tracheostomy, or at least 2 of these 3 scores to scale ALS-FRS-R score of 1 under Swallowing (requires additional enteral feeding), gait score of 1 under (only functional movements that not carry on walking) or score of 3 under Respiratory failure (continuous use of BiPAP at night).

Five stopped prematurely (less than 3 months after lithium initiation) due to intolerance. Of 23 patients treated for a mean time of 6 months, 54% were male, mean age of onset was 56 + or -11 years, mean disease duration prior to lithium was 25 + or -16 months. Two patients died during treatment: One had a tracheostomy at 3 months and one died at 8 months. In Group 2, 27 patients were treated with lithium. Six stopped prematurely: two had intolerance; three perceived rapid worsening; and one suddenly died. Of 21 patients treated for a mean time of 6 months, 48% were male, mean age of symptom onset was 54 + or -12 years and mean disease duration prior to lithium was 36 + or -20 months. Four patients died during treatment within 7 months. The rate of weight loss on lithium was greater (Group1: 0.49 kg/month; Group 2: 0.46 kg/month) compared to the rate of weight loss prior to lithium (Group 1: 0.01 kg/month, P= 0.04; Group 2: 0.04 kg/month, P=0.02). The rate of ALSFRS decline after lithium treatment was also greater (Group 1: 1.5 points (pts)/month; Group 2: 0.95 pts/month) compared to prior to lithium (Group 1: 1.1 pts/month; Group 2: 0.64 pts/month). Conclusion: The experience of lithium therapy among ALS patients in the centers was consistent and an increased weight loss on lithium therapy was noted. Weight loss cannot be excluded for being responsible for global worsening. Additionally, patients died while on lithium therapy which is different from that published previously. Worsening with lithium therapy should be considered, as it has already been observed in prior drugs that were thought to be promising. These data underline the need to strictly monitor lithium therapy. Only a well-designed randomized controlled trial can determine true efficacy and side effect profile.

Results: Six patients stopped prematurely LC. Two had intolerance, 3 due an impression of more rapid worsening and 1 suddenly died. Three others died during their treatment: 2 after 4 months and 1 after 7 months. All the 4 patients who died had respiratory failure. To date, out of the 21 remaining patients, 12 have had 3 evaluations (M0, M3 and M6). They were 6 men and 6 women with mean age of onset of ALS of 59yrs 10 and mean ALS duration of 31 months 24. The ALSFRS RW before LC was 0.74 points/month and 1.18 under therapy. Only 3 patients had a slower decline with LC and one of them died after 7 months of treatment. Weight loss (WL) before LC was -0.17kgs/month and worsened to -0.77 during treatment (p=0.22). Conclusions/Relevance: Our experience of LC in ALS patients is different than that published by Fornai et al. Four patients died when none died after 15 months of LC for Fornai's. The major part of our patients had a more rapid RW under LC together with a higher WL. We cannot exclude that WL is responsible for the worsening, but other drugs in the past years have shown to worsen ALS patients. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2009seattle/view.php?nu=AAN09L_P07.158&terms=",,TrialTroveID-107925,,,,107925,,,,Ii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Two patients discontinued treatment and one died before the target therapeutic lithium concentration could be achieved. 63 (59%) of 107 patients in the placebo group and 54 (50%) of 107 patients in the lithium group were alive at 18 months. The survival functions did not differ significantly between groups (Mantel-Cox log-rank ?2 on 1 df=1·64; p=0·20). After adjusting for study centre and site of onset using logistic regression, the relative odds of survival at 18 months (lithium vs placebo) was 0·71 (95% CI 0·40–1·24). 56 patients in the placebo group and 61 in the lithium group had at least one serious adverse event. Conclusion: We found no evidence of benefit of lithium on survival in patients with ALS, but nor were there safety concerns, which had been identified in previous studies with less conventional designs. This finding emphasises the importance of pursuing adequately powered trials with clear endpoints when testing new treatments. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23453347 Full TEXT Avialable: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442213700371 http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1474442213700371/1-s2.0-S1474442213700371-main.pdf?_tid=6c0678b0-8622-11e2-951e-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1362549497_05828096ec548cd399454b7a5b0575a1","Secondary outcome measure: Secondary outcome measures, which comprised functional health status measured with the ALS functional rating scale-revised(ALSFRS-R), mental health state measured with the hospital anxiety and depression scale, and quality of life measured with the EuroQol (the EuroQoL group 5-dimension self-report questionnaire health state tariff and health evaluation scale), were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months.

The survival benefit attributed to PB&TURSO in this analysis aligns with prior analyses using statistical models controlling for placebo-to-active crossover in CENTAUR. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-001382.html; April 14, 2010 Presented at 62nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 10-17, 2010, Toronto, Canada Abstract No. IN6-1.003 Swati P.

The hazard ratio of reaching the primary endpoint was 1·13 (95% CI 0·61—2·07). The study was stopped at the first interim analysis because criterion for futility was met (p = 0·78). The difference in mean decline in the ALS functional rating scale score between the lithium group and the placebo group was 0·15 (95% CI -0·43 to 0·73, p = 0·61). There were no major safety concerns. Falls (p = 0·04) and back pain (p = 0·05) were more common in the lithium group than in the placebo group. Interpretation: We found no evidence that lithium in combination with riluzole slows progression of ALS more than riluzole alone. The time-to-event endpoint and use of prespecified interim analyses enabled a clear result to be obtained rapidly. This design should be considered for future trials testing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs that are easily accessible to people with ALS. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(10)70068-5/abstract http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363190?dopt=abstract; December 08, 2009 Presented at 20th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2009, Berlin, Germany Abstract: LB346 Aggarwal S, Zinman L, Simpson E, Mckinley J, Jackson K, Pinto H, Watson M, Tindall K, Sherman A, Yu H, Lanka V, Paliwal Y, Nelson K, Schoenfeld D, Conwit R, Shefner J, Cudkowicz M Clinical trial testing lithium carbonate and riluzole in patients with ALS terminates early for futility Results: At the pre-specified first interim analysis, criteria for futility were met (one-sided p-value +0.775).

Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS (12), age 21-85 years, forced vital capacity (FVC) greater than or equal to 75% of predicted, and onset of weakness within 3 years. Patients taking riluzole were on a stable dose for at least 30 days. Pre-assignment Details: This was an open label single-arm Phase II screening trail. All enrolled subjects (n=109) were treated. Their results were compared with placebo subjects from an historical database of ALS placebo patients from recent studies (n=249). Thus the number enrolled (n=109) does not equal the total number of subjects (n=358). Enrolled subjects started lithium carbonate at 150 mg twice daily. If subjects did not tolerate a dose it was tapered by 150 mg increments to the maximum tolerated dosage.

Results: The mean rate of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised was greater in 107 patients taking lithium carbonate (-1.20/month, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.41 to -0.98) than that in 249 control patients (-1.01/month, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.92, p = 0.04). There were no differences in secondary outcome measures (forced vital capacity, time to failure, and quality of life), but there were more adverse events in the treated group. Conclusions: The lack of therapeutic benefit and safety concerns, taken together with similar results from 2 other recent trials, weighs against the use of lithium carbonate in patients with ALS. The absence of drift over time and the availability of a large database of patients for selecting a matched historical control group suggest that use of historical controls may result in more efficient phase II trials for screening putative ALS therapeutic agents. Classification of evidence: This study provided Class IV evidence that lithium carbonate does not slow the rate of decline of function in patients with ALS over 13 months. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813790 http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2011/08/03/WNL.0b013e31822dc7a5.abstract; April 13, 2010 Presented at 62nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 10-17, 2010, Toronto, Canada Abstract No. S16.002 Robert Miller, Dallas Forshew, Jonathan Katz, Dan Moore, Mark Spitalny, Michael Valan, Richard Barohn, Mark Bromberg, Kimberly Goslin, Michael Graves, Leo McCluskey, April McVeyn, Tahseen Mozaffar, Alan Pestronk, Mark Ross, Ericka Simpson Phase II Controlled Trial of Lithium Carbonate in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: 109 patients were enrolled at 10 Western ALS study group (WALS) sites. At the time of this writing, 28% of patients have completed the 12-month treatment course and 3% have been terminated prematurely because of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Conclusions: A Phase II trial of lithium carbonate in ALS patients is near completion. Safety and efficacy results will be presented. Comparison of these results with concurrent lithium trials will be important for future ALS clinical trials, as the novel placebo control design in this trial allows all patients to receive active treatment. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_S16.002","Secondary outcome measures: Vital Capacity.

Marie-Catherine Boll , Mireya Alcaraz Zubeldia , Camilo Rios , Dinora González-Esquivel , Sergio Montes A phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a valproate/lithium combination in ALS patients Results: Out of 42 enrolled patients, 20 individuals given VPA-Li and 18 under placebo were included in the final analysis. In total, 45% of patients receiving VPA-Li completed the trial, whereas only 22.22% of patients in the placebo group attended the final visit, 18 months later (P = 0.09). Major changes in the ALSFRS-R score were observed, including a decrease of 1.195 points/month in the placebo group (95% CI: 0.7869-1.6031) and of 0.5085 under VPA-Li treatment (95% CI: 0.2288-0.7882) between months 6 and 14. Adverse events included bad mouth taste, constipation, and anorexia. Survival rate, body weight, and quality of life were positive outcomes by the end of the trial despite a high sample reduction, especially in the placebo group. Including 212 subjects in each group would confirm these differences. Conclusions: A combined VPA-Li treatment was linked to a slower ALS progression and better primary and secondary outcomes.

Although this population had more advanced disease compared to other trials, retention and adherence were very high. There was no significant effect of Lunasin treatment on histone acetylation or disease progression. A cohort following our protocol outside the trial reported similar side effects and perceived effectiveness; however, their compliance with data entry was markedly lower. CONCLUSIONS: While Lunasin's lack of efficacy is disappointing, our novel trial design had the highest ALS trial enrollment rate ever recorded, with excellent retention and adherence.

Interim Results: 50 participants enrolled in 5.5 months. Participants were primarily white (94%) males (58%), mean age 60 and disease duration four years. As of 5/17, 10 participants had completed all 12 months of treatment. The final enrolled participant finishes 9/17. Six participants died prior to completion. No deaths were related to treatment. Fifteen participants stopped treatment; 10 of these continue in the study. Protocol adherence, data density and agreement between coordinator- and participant-obtained measures have all been very high. Most participants report little or no protocol burden and no side-effects. Constipation is the most common adverse event possibly related to Lunasin and has been severe in a few cases. Initial biomarker analyses show no changes in histone acetylation relative to controls. Most participants report no clear perceived effectiveness. No ALS reversals have occurred. Analysis of ALSFRS-R progression compared to historical controls will occur after the final participant completes treatment and will be presented at the Symposium. Of the many patients self-experimenting with Lunasin, 52 are recording outcome data on PatientsLikeMe. Compared to enrolled participants, these have similar demographics, reported adherence, perceived burdens, side-effects and effectiveness. However, their data density is markedly lower. Conclusions: To date, Lunasin appears reasonably safe and tolerable. Unfortunately, we have not found evidence that it influences histone acetylation or ALS progression. Final safety, tolerability, biomarkers and efficacy measures will be presented at the Symposium. On the other hand, our novel trial design had the highest ALS enrollment rate ever recorded, along with excellent retention, adherence, data density and agreement between coordinator- and participant-obtained outcome measures. We will use similar patient-centric designs in future pilot trials. Low data density from patients who are selfexperimenting warrants caution in interpretation and casts doubt on the possibility of gathering useful information from unsupervised expanded access programmes.

Lunasin regimen can alter histone acetylation in patients with ALS (PALS). Participants can accurately measure their own ALSFRS-R score and record it on Patients Like Me relative to data capture by a healthcare professional. Patients can accurately measure their own weight and record it on Patients Like Me relative to data capture by a healthcare professional. The novel features of this pilot trial will be associated with improved participant enrollment compared to prior more traditional ALS trials where this is 2 participants per site per month. The novel features of this pilot trial will be associated with improved participant retention compared to prior more traditional ALS trials where the dropout rate is 22%. Secondary Outcome Measures: Change in H3 Histone Acetylation [ Time Frame: Screening/baseline, Month 1 ] Participants, ALS controls (not on Lunasin) and healthy controls (not on Lunasin) had blood drawn at baseline and 1 month time points. Histones were extracted from blood cells. Western blots were used to look at specific histone acetylation patterns that Lunasin had reportedly altered in cell cultures (H3K9K14ac2 and H4K5K8K12K16). Integrated density values for AcH3 protein bands were normalized for total H3. Percent H3 values for the 1 month time point were normalized to that of the baseline visit. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Percent Agreement Between the Weights Obtained by Patients and Study Coordinator [ Time Frame: Month 1, Month 12 ] To confirm that participants can accurately measure their own weight, even as they become more disabled by ALS, the investigators will compare the participant-generated weight with the weight obtained by the study coordinator at the Month 1 and Month 12 visits.

Results 13 subjects received PR006 at 2 dose levels (Table 1). A planned interim analysis was performed after subjects in the low dose cohort finished the 1-year main study period. PR006 administration was generally safe and well-tolerated.

Safety and Tolerability,1,"April 3, 2024 [Press release] AB SCIENCE ANNOUNCES THAT HEALTH CANADA HAS GRANTED ELIGIBILITY FOR RECONSIDERATION REQUEST FOR MASITINIB IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS AB Science SA (Euronext - FR0010557264 - AB) today announces that Health Canada has granted eligibility for reconsideration request for masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The reconsideration process will re-examine, with new assessors, the decision based on information that was included in the original submission. A Notice of Deficiency-Withdrawal (NOD/w) was issued on February 19, 2024 by Health Canada regarding the New Drug Submission (NDS) for masitinib in the treatment of ALS. The intention to submit a reconsideration request was based on the arguments summarized in the press release dated 26 February 2024. Health Canada and AB Science have held a meeting to discuss the reconsideration process. AB Science is working closely with the agency to facilitate the review of masitinib conditional approval in ALS. AB Science has 45 days to file the reconsideration request. The pivotal argument is on the treatment of missing data. Various sensitivity analyses show that study AB10015 was successful at week 48 when masitinib missing data are imputed as a placebo, which is recognized as a highly conservative methodology for missing data imputation (i.e., jump-to-reference). Rerandomization calculation, which ignores whether the data distribution is linear or not, was also successful. Furthermore, the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) analysis showed a p-value of 0.078, even though study AB10015 was not powered for this endpoint. A related time-to-event endpoint, Progression Free Survival (PFS), did show significant improvement in favor of masitinib. Additionally, in the subgroup of patients with ‘ALS prior to any loss of function’, a logically defined cohort based on masitinib’s mechanism of action, a long-term median overall survival (OS) benefit of +22 months (p=0.0192) was observed. Professor Albert Ludolph, MD, PhD, Medical Director of the Neurology Department of at the University of Ulm, and principal investor of masitinib confirmatory study in ALS commented that, “The recent failure of numerous phase 2 or 3 programs, including registered drugs such as AMX0035 (Amylyx) and oral edaravone (Ferrer), as well as investigational drugs such as TUDCA (the TUDCA-ALS consortium), reldesemtiv (Cytokinetics) and the RIPK1 inhibitor SAR443820 (Sanofi), have dashed the community's hopes of benefiting from new therapeutic advances and have effectively set us back with riluzole being the only treatment with a proven modest effect in the overall ALS population. We should learn from theses failures. First, that demonstration of efficacy over a 24-week period is not predictive of efficacy over a 48-week period, which is the adequate duration to demonstrate a disease modifying effect in ALS. Second, that a 48-week study inevitably generates a large number of missing data. This situation is not unique to masitinib. It is a real challenge in the evaluation of efficacy and we are at risk of overlooking promising compounds. Masitinib has published results over a 48-week period, positive when appropriate methodology to treat missing data is applied, and it deserves careful consideration”. https://www.ab-science.com/ab-science-announces-that-health-canada-has-granted-eligibility-for-reconsideration-request-for-masitinib-in-als/; April 12, 2023 [Press release] [Additional analysis] RESULTS OF MASITINIB IN ALS SELECTED FOR A SCIENTIFIC PLATFORM PRESENTATION AT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY 2023 ANNUAL MEETING, INCLUDING LONG-TERM SURVIVAL ANALYSIS AND NEW ANALYSIS OF PATIENT POPULATION WITH NO COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNCTION AT BASELINE AB Science SA (Euronext – FR0010557264 – AB) today announced that Professor Albert Ludolph, MD, PhD (Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital and Medical Faculty of Ulm), will deliver a presentation on masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to an audience of key opinion leaders in the field of ALS healthcare, at the up-coming American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2023 Annual Meeting in Boston, USA (April 22-27, 2023). The AAN Annual Meeting is the world’s premier neurology meeting, attracting over 10,000 neurology professionals from around the globe. The title of this presentation is ‘Masitinib Shows Prolonged Survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients with Mild or Moderate Disease Severity at Baseline’. The abstract will be published in an online supplement to the journal Neurology. Included in this presentation are the long-term survival data that showed a significantly prolonged survival of 25 months in favor of masitinib for patients with non-severe disease severity at baseline. Furthermore, new analyses performed for the regulatory authorities have shown that starting masitinib treatment in ALS patients prior to any complete loss of physical function (corresponding to a score of 0 on each ALSFRS-R individual component) resulted in a significant treatment-effect across multiple endpoints at week 48, including the joint rank analysis of function and survival (CAFS), which is a key regulatory endpoint. Of note, this latter population includes all patients regardless of baseline progression rate and encompasses about 80% of the overall AB10015 study population. Moreover, exclusion of patients with a complete loss of function is justified in the context of treating neurodegenerative disease, any improvement in lost function being beyond what can be reasonably expected from an interventional drug, no matter how effective it may be in preventing further progression. Professor Olivier Hermine, MD, PhD (President of the Scientific Committee of AB Science and member of the Académie des Sciences in France) said, “Once a clinical study has met its primary objective, it is methodologically acceptable to identify populations that enrich benefit-risk. Furthermore, retrospective analyses based on overall survival are also acceptable, as this is a highly robust endpoint. Beyond the already known increased long-term survival data from patients with moderate ALS severity, masitinib has now been shown to produce a significant treatment-effect on the key regulatory accepted outcome of CAFS, provided that treatment starts prior to any complete loss of physical functionality.” As a reminder, the development program of masitinib in ALS comprises a 48-week clinical trial (AB10015), including long-term survival follow-up analysis, and an on-going confirmatory phase 3 trial (AB19001). Study AB10015 previously showed that masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day) as an add-on to standard riluzole, significantly slowed functional decline at week 48 in patients with an ALSFRS-R progression rate of less than 1.1 points/month at baseline, relative to those treated with riluzole alone. Furthermore, long-term follow-up analysis of this population showed a significantly prolonged survival of 25 months for masitinib treated patients that had moderate ALS at baseline... https://www.ab-science.com/results-of-masitinib-in-als-selected-for-a-scientific-platform-presentation-at-the-aan-2023-including-long-term-survival-analysis-and-a-new-analysis-of-patient-population-with-no-complete-loss-of-fun/; March 2, 2023 AAN 2023 Available online date: March 2, 2023 Albert Ludolph Olivier Hermine Masitinib Shows Prolonged Survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients with Mild or Moderate Disease Severity at Baseline Results: In ALS patients with mild or moderate disease severity at baseline (i.e., patients with =2 on each ALSFRS-R individual component) and ?FS <1.1 points/month (i.e., exclusion of faster progressors), masitinib 4.5mg/kg/d (n=45) prolonged survival by 25 months relative to those treated with riluzole alone (n=62) (median OS of 69 versus 44 months, respectively, P=0.037) with a 47% reduced risk of death (Hazard Ratio 0.53 (95%CI[0.31–0.92]); P=0.025). Significant treatment-effect for this cohort was also observed for ?ALSFRS-R at week-48 and time-to-event analysis (PFS). Conversely, no long-term survival advantage was observed for the overall masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/d cohort of study AB10015 (regardless of baseline disease severity or ?FS) or for the low-dose (3.0 mg/kg/d) masitinib treatment-arm. Conclusions: Taken together, a consistently significant treatment effect in terms of median OS, hazard ratio of death, ?ALSFRS-R and PFS, provides evidence that oral masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/d) can slow ALS progression, provided that patients have not suffered severe impairment of ALSFRS-related functionality at the time of treatment initiation. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-003698.html; December 16, 2021 EU Clinical Trials Register Results Summary EudraCT number: 2010-024423-24 Trial protocol: ES GR SK IT HU PT IE NL Global completion date: 01 Nov 2017 Results information Results version number: v1(current) This version publication date: 16 Dec 2021 First version publication date: 16 Dec 2021 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2010-024423-24/results; November 17, 2021 [Sub-group analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 22, Issue supplement 2, November 2021 Presented at the 32nd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 7-10, 2021, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2021 Abstract No. CLT-20 J.

Ludolph; Long-term survival analysis from Masitinib early access named patient program Results: The cohorts of ‘NPP-M4.5’, ‘NPP-M[pooled]’ and ‘masitinib-naive PBO’ comprised 29, 59, and 53 patients, respectively. Assessment of baseline imbalances showed no indication of self-selection bias. Kaplan-Meier survival curves visually showed divergence between NPP subpopulations and the placebo comparator arm, indicating a consistent survival advantage in favor of masitinib. Survival was significantly prolonged by 11 months in the ‘NPP-M4.5’ cohort relative to ‘masitinib-naive PBO’ (median OS of 73 (95%CI[69–NE]) versus 62 (95%CI[49–NE]) months, respectively, p = 0.008), with a significant 67% reduced risk of death (Hazard Ratio 0.33 (95%CI[0.12–0.88]); p = 0.027). Likewise, survival was significantly prolonged (11 months, p = 0.008), for the ‘NPP-M[pooled]’ cohort relative to ‘masitinib-naive PBO’, despite an inevitable dilution from ‘NPP-M3.0’ patients, with a 42% reduced risk of death (0.58 (95%CI[0.28–1.19]); p = 0.134). Discussion: This analysis effectively avoids confounding effects related to treatment switch-over (i.e. placebo patients switching to masitinib). NPP long-term OS analysis showed a significant survival advantage in favor of masitinib-treated patients as compared with masitinib-naive patients. This benefit is consistent with results from long-term OS analysis of the overall study population, even in the absence of patient enrichment.

Mora Long-term follow-up of masitinib study AB10015 shows prolonged survival in patients that start treatment prior to severe impairment of functionality Results: The survival analysis followed all patients originally randomized in study AB10015 for an average duration of 75 months (time of diagnosis until long-term OS analysis cutoff). Consistent with previously communicated results (1), no long-term survival advantage was observed for the overall masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day cohort of study AB10015 (i.e. regardless of baseline disease severity or Delta FS) or for the low-dose (3.0 mg/kg/day) masitinib treatment-arm. Conversely, in ALS patients with mild or moderate disease severity at baseline and DFS < 1.1 points/month, masitinib 4.5mg/kg/day (n = 45) prolonged survival by 25 months relative to those treated with riluzole alone (n = 62) (median OS of 69 versus 44 months, respectively, p = 0.037) with a 47% reduced risk of death (Hazard Ratio 0.53 (95%CI [0.31–0.92]); p = 0.025). People with mild or moderate ALS comprised patients that had not suffered a complete loss or severe impairment of ALSFRS-related functionality at the time of masitinib treatment initiation (i.e. patients with a score of at least 2 on each ALSFRS-R individual component). Survival data for this cohort of patients were corroborated by the effect observed in the endpoints of DALSFRS-R at week-48 and time-to-event analysis (PFS), further supporting the premise of greater treatment effect when masitinib is initiated at an earlier stage of disease. Discussion: These positive survival results provide evidence that the main efficacy outcomes of study AB10015, i.e. DALSFRS-R at week-48 (according to the primary endpoint and sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation jumpto-reference techniques) and PFS, are legitimate surrogate endpoints for long-term OS. Results are also consistent with masitinib’s mechanism of action, which is expected to provide better outcomes if administered early in disease progression (2). Confirmatory study AB19001 is ongoing with a primary endpoint of decline in ALSFRS-R from baseline to week-48 in the enriched patient population described herein.

This publication presents entirely new data on the analysis of long-term survival of masitinib in combination with riluzole in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the randomized clinical trial AB10015 [2]. The survival analysis concerned all the patients initially recruited in study AB10015 for a mean duration of 75 months from the date of diagnosis. In patients with ALS whose disease severity was mild or moderate at the time of inclusion, treatment with masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg / kg / day (n = 50) was observed in combination with riluzole prolonged survival by 25 months compared to patients treated with riluzole alone (n = 63) (median overall survival of 69 months versus 44 months, respectively, P = 0.037), with a reduction in the risk of death by 44%. People with mild or moderate ALS correspond to patients who have not suffered complete loss or severe functional impairment as measured by the ALSFRS score at the time of the initiation of treatment with masitinib (i.e. patients with a score of at least 2 on each individual component of the ALSFRS-R score). This population closely corresponds to the population of patients recruited in the phase 3 confirmatory study, AB19001. Dr Jesús S. Mora, MD, Director of the ALS Unit at San Rafael Hospital in Madrid and lead author of the article said: “ This publication represents an important new scientific step in the search for a new treatment in ALS. The importance of the gain in survival observed with masitinib compared to placebo is very encouraging and the data from study AB10015 have now demonstrated a systematically significant treatment effect in terms of overall survival, hazard ratio, slowing of the rate of functional decline and slowing deterioration of respiratory function and quality of life. "" Professor Albert Ludolph, Professor of Neurology and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at University Hospital and Ulm Faculty of Medicine in Germany, and International Coordinator of Study AB19001, said: “These long survival data term, with a mean follow-up of 75 months from diagnosis, suggest that masitinib may offer a substantial survival benefit when treatment is initiated before severe loss of function . These results are consistent with the therapeutic objective of masitinib which aims to preserve neuromuscular functions. Phase 3 confirmatory study underway(AB19001), conducted in patients with ALS with mild or moderate loss of functionality at the time of inclusion, fits this population perfectly. "" These survival data were corroborated by the observed effect on endpoints Delta ALSFRS-R at week 48 and on progression-free survival (PFS, a time-dependent analysis) for this patient population, which confirms the hypothesis of a greater treatment effect when the treatment is initiated at an earlier stage of the disease. In accordance with the results previously reported on study AB10015 [2], no advantage in terms of long-term survival was observed for the overall population of study AB10015 with masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg / kg / day (i.e. regardless of disease severity at baseline or rate of progression of the ALSFRS-R score after disease onset) or for the low dose masitinib treatment arm (3.0 mg / kg / day). These long-term survival results are consistent with the mechanism of action of masitinib, which significantly slows microglia-related disease progression and prevents denervation of mast cell-related neuromuscular junctions as well as Schwann cell-induced neuroinflammation. [3-7]. Based on this mechanism of action, masitinib may give better results if given early in disease progression, https://www.ab-science.com/publication-of-new-survival-data-showing-that-masitinib-extended-survival-in-als-by-25-months-relative-to-placebo/; July 07, 2019 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2019 Jul 7:1-10. doi: 10.1080/21678421.2019.1632346.

Conversely, no significant treatment-effect according to ?ALSFRS-R was seen for the broader ""Normal and Fast Progressor"" masitinib 4.5?mg/kg/d cohort, or either of the low-dose (masitinib 3.0?mg/kg/d) cohorts. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (regardless of causality or post-onset ?FS) were 88% with masitinib 4.5?mg/kg/d, 85% with 3.0?mg/kg/d, and 79% with placebo. Likewise, rates of serious AE were 31, 23, and 18%, respectively. No distinct event contributed to the higher rate observed for masitinib and no deaths were related to masitinib. Conclusions: Results show that masitinib at 4.5?mg/kg/d can benefit patients with ALS. A confirmatory phase 3 study will be initiated to substantiate these data. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280619 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2019.1632346; November 7, 2017 Amyotrophic and Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 18, S2, Pages 1-337, Published online: 7 Nov 2017 Presented at the 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2017, Boston, MA Abstract No. C22 JS Mora; Masitinib as an add-on therapy to riluzole is safe and effective in the treatment of ALS Results: 394 patients (‘Normal + Faster Progressor’ cohort); were randomized to the M4.5 (130), M3.0 (131) and placebo (133) arms. The NP cohort comprised 330 patients: 106, 110 and 114, respectively. For the primary endpoint analysis (M4.5 in NP), masitinib showed a significant benefit in DALSFRS-R over placebo with a least-square means difference (DLSM) of 3.4 (9.2 vs. 12.6); 95% CI 0.6–6.1; p = 0.0158. In terms of ALSFRS-R slope, masitinib showed a clinically meaningful retardation of 27% (0.77 vs. 1.21 points/month). All sensitivity analyses were positive, with p less than 0.02 according to imputation methodology. Masitinib also demonstrated benefit over placebo in the secondary variables, significantly improving median PFS by 25% (20 vs. 16 months, p = 0.0159); ALSAQ40 by 28.5% (DLSM of 19.4 vs. 27.2, p = 0.0078); and FVC by 22% (DLSM of 26.0 vs. 33.4, p = 0.0332). For M3.0 in NP, masitinib showed benefit over placebo for DALSFRSR = 2.73 (–8.6 vs. –11.3, a 24% improvement, p = 0.0661); ALSAQ40 (DLSM of 15.6 vs. 23.7, a 34% improvement, p = 0.0057); and FVC (DLSM of –23.1 vs. –27.9, a 17% improvement, p = 0.1662). No significant difference was seen between treatment arms for analysis according to the ‘Normal + Faster Progressor’ cohorts. Post-hoc analysis selecting patients with less than 24- month duration of illness and score for each ALSFRS-R item of at least 2, showed enhanced treatment-effect in terms of DALSFRS-R, with a DLSM of 4.5, corresponding to a 42% improvement, p = 0.0176. This indicates greater benefit is possible with early treatment. Common (greater than 10%) adverse events (AEs) with masitinib in the NP cohort were rash, nausea, diarrhoea, and weight loss. Frequency of AEs, serious AEs, and severe AEs (placebo versus M4.5 and M3) was, respectively: 79% vs. 90% and 84%; 20% vs. 28% and 18%; 18% vs. 24% and 17%. Discussion and conclusion: Masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/d demonstrated a significant therapeutic benefit with acceptable safety in ALS patients with a baseline ALSFRS-R progression rate of less than 1.1 points/month.

Raul Juntas-Morales, Nicolas Pageot , Abdelkarim Bendarraz , Sébastien Alphandéry , Frédéric Sedel , Stéphanie Seigle , William Camu High-dose Pharmaceutical Grade Biotin (MD1003) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Pilot Study Results: Between June and December 2016, 30 patients were enrolled (MD1003, n = 20; placebo, n = 10). Baseline characteristics were representative of the ALS population. MD1003 and placebo groups were not well balanced at screening, with the MD1003-treated group having a higher rate of ALSFRS-R decline prior to screening versus placebo (-6·0 IQR [-8·5, -5·0] vs. -5·0 IQR [-5·0, -3·0]) and a predominance of ALS with upper limb onset compared to placebo (35% vs. 10%). MD1003 had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated. The occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups (60%). Two deaths occurred in the MD1003 group versus 1 in the placebo group. ALSFRS-R median change from baseline to month 6 was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0·49); the mean difference between groups was -1·6 (SEM=3·3). Conclusion: MD1003 treatment was safe and well tolerated. It was not possible to establish MD1003 efficacy in this relatively small study. Given the favourable safety profile of MD1003 and an imbalance between treatment groups favouring placebo, additional, larger studies in ALS are warranted. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32140672/ Full text available at: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(19)30263-9/fulltext https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046518/; November 7, 2017 Amyotrophic and Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 18, S2, Pages 1-337, Published online: 7 Nov 2017 Presented at the 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2017, Boston, MA Abstract No. CLT-22 R Juntas-Morales, N Pageot, A Bendarraz, G Brion, O Simon, F Sedel, W Camu; A pilot trial of high dose biotin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Interim Results: Thirty patients were recruited from July to December 2016, in the ALS center of Montpellier, France. They were mean aged 57.5 years 10.4 at ALS onset and the gender ratio was 2.33:1 (21 men and 9 women). Site of onset was bulbar in 5 (17%), upper limb in 12 (40%) and lower limb in 13 (43%). At treatment start, mean ALS duration was 21.5 months 6.3, mean ALSFRS score was 34.4 4.9, mean SVC was 89.1 21.3 and mean weight was 74 kg 11.3. By the end of April 2017, 90% of the patients had ended the double-blind part of the trial and no safety concern had been raised. The last patient will end the double-blind part of this study in mid-June. To date, 4 patients died during the double-blind period and in all the cases no other cause than evolution of ALS could be identified. Discussion: This pilot trial is using a drug, Biotin, that reached efficacy in PMS, a disorder mainly characterized clinically by degeneration of upper motor neurons. As in MS, OG have been implicated in ALS pathogenesis and we considered it important to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Biotin in this devastating disorder. The 6-month double-blind period will end in June 2017 and detailed results will be presented at the meeting.

A total of 129 patients were eligible for the full analysis set, and 126 completed the double-blind stage. Of these, 124 patients proceeded to the open-label extended period. The least square means difference in ALSFRS-R total score at week 16 of the randomized period was 1.97 points greater with methylcobalamin than placebo (-2.66 vs -4.63; 95% CI, 0.44-3.50; P = .01). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions and relevance: Results of this randomized clinical trial showed that ultrahigh-dose methylcobalamin was efficacious in slowing functional decline in patients with early-stage ALS and with moderate progression rate and was safe to use during the 16-week treatment period. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35532908/ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.0901; October 3, 2021 [Pooled analysis] Presented at the 25th World Congress of Neurology (WCN), October 3-7, 2021, Virtual meeting Abstract No. Ryuji Kaji CLINICAL TRIALS: EMERGING RESULTS Results and Conclusion: Phase 1-2 trial of antisense oligonucleotide tofersen for ALS due to SOD1 mutations has been reported with promising results(Miller et al. NEJM 2020). This substance is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting at lowering concentration of mutant SOD1 mRNA, directly attacking pathogenesis. The outcome of phase 3 high-dose intramuscular methylcobalamin (JETALS) has just come out with positive results, retarding the decline of ALSFRS-R(Izumi et al. 2021, fig.) This trial was the first to adopt Awaji criteria, entering patients within 12 months after the onset. Its phase 2-3 trial (E0301) was not successful in those within 3 years after onset, but its subanalysis of those within 1 year of onset showed efficacy on ALSFRS-R decline and longer survival ( > 600 days) than control(Kaji et al. JNNP 2018). JETALS was designed to examine only ALSFRS-R, but according to E-0301 study, it likely prolongs the survival, if the patients started the therapy within 12 months after onset.

Ultra-high-dose methylcobalamin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a long-term phase II/III randomised controlled study RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in either primary endpoint (minimal p value=0.087). However, post-hoc analyses of methylcobalamin-treated patients diagnosed and entered early (=12 months' duration) showed longer time intervals to the primary event (p<0.025) and less decreases in the ALSFRS-R score (p<0.025) than the placebo group. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was similar and low in all groups. CONCLUSION: Although ultra-high-dose methylcobalamin did not show significant efficacy in the whole cohort, this treatment may prolong survival and retard symptomatic progression without major side effects if started early. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636701 Full text available at https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/12/jnnp-2018-319294.long; April 23, 2015 Presented at the 67th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 18-25, 2015, Washington, DC Session Title: P7: Poster Session VII: Neuromuscular Disease: Clinical Trials and Treatment Abstract No.: P7.060 Ryuji Kaji,Shigeki Kuzuhara,Yasuo Iwasaki,Koichi Okamoto,Masanori Nakagawa,Takashi Imai,Takao Takase,Hiroki Shimizu,Kunio Tashiro Ultra-high dose methylcobalamin (E0302) prolongs survival of ALS: Report of 7 years’ randomised double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial Results: Of 373 patients, 370 (placebo 123, 25mg 124, 50mg 123) constituted the full analysis set. In both endpoints, there was no statistical significance in the comparison for the two dose response contrasts (linear and saturate hypothesis). For the patients who were given diagnosis of ALS within 12months after the onset (placebo 48, 25mg 54, 50mg 42), the event-free survival was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner (P=0.010, hazard ratio [95%CI] vs 25mg, 50mg were 0.640 [0.377, 1.085], 0.498 [0.267, 0.929], respectively) and ALSFRS-R changes were smaller in active groups (P=0.003) than in placebo. No adverse events of particular concern were noted. Discussion: The diagnosis of ALS with revised El Escorial criteria is often delayed but newly-devised Awaji criteria have enabled earlier diagnosis. Patients are less likely to benefit from ultra-high dose methylcobalamin treatment if more than 2 to 3 years have passed since the onset of ALS. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated for the first time that ultra-high dose methylcobalamin can significantly prolong survival and retard progression in ALS if administered early. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN15L1_P7.060","Secondary Outcome Measures: Manual Muscle Test (MMT) [ Time Frame: Every 3 months. ] Percent-predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) [ Time Frame: Every 3 months. ] The secondary endpoints included muscle strength assessed using the manual muscle test (Medical Research Council Scale), physical functional status measured with the Norris Scale,16 respiratory function assessed using %FVC, grip strength, and the quality of life evaluated using the ALS Assessment Questionnaire-40.",E0302-J081-761 JapicCTI-070433 NCT00444613 TrialTroveID-078715,"Primary Outcome Measures: Survival rate [ Time Frame: Every 3 months. ] Functional rating scale.

Li P, Quan W, Zhou YY, Wang Y, Zhang HH, Liu S Efficacy of memantine on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with the severity of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia: A six-month, open-label, self-controlled clinical trial. Results: Memantine treatment had no effect on overall NPI-Q scores, with the exception of the agitation subdomain in all patients with bvFTD. However, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD exhibited a better performance than patients with mild bvFTD, demonstrated by improved NPI-Q total scores and subscales of agitation, depression, apathy and disinhibition. In the moderate-to-severe group, CDR and HAMD scores remained stable, but MMSE, MoCA and ADL scores were reduced after 6 months of treatment. Memantine was well-tolerated in patients. Conclusion: Patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD responded significantly better to memantine in comparison to patients with mild bvFTD with regard to their neuropsychiatric scores, while memantine did not present any cognitive or functional benefits in patients with mild bvFTD. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a larger number of patients is required to verify these promising results for patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347084 Full text available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4906973/","Secondary endpoint assessments included the following: Chinese version of the MoCA and MMSE scores (range, 0–30 for both; high scores indicate better cognitive function); ADL scale including two major categories, Basic Activity of Daily Life (BADL) and Instrumental Activity of Daily Life (IADL; high scores indicate greater impairment); and the HAMD (high scores indicate greater impairment)",TrialTroveID-315916,Primary endpoint parameters included the baseline-to-endpoint changes in the NPI Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and CDR; high scores indicate greater impairment.,"60 outpatients from October 2008 to October 2014 were diagnosed with bvFTD according to consensus diagnostic criteria (22,23).

Memantine in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. FINDINGS: Of 100 patients screened, 81 were randomly assigned to receive memantine (39 patients) or placebo (42 patients). Five (6%) patients discontinued, and 76 completed the 26-week treatment. Enrolment numbers were lower than planned because of many patients' preference to take memantine or cholinesterase inhibitors off-label rather than participate in a clinical trial. Memantine treatment had no effect on either the NPI (mean difference 2·2, 95% CI -3·9 to 8·3, p=0·47) or CGIC (mean difference 0·0, -0·4 to 0·4, p=0·90) after 26 weeks of treatment. Memantine was generally well tolerated; however, patients in the memantine group had more frequent cognitive adverse events (six patients) than those in the placebo group (one).

A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency(1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score(range 0-144);higher score=greater behavioral disturbances;negative change score from baseline=improvement.

[Epub ahead of print] Levine TD, Bowser R, Hank N, Saperstein D A pilot trial of memantine and riluzole in ALS: Correlation to CSF biomarkers Results: Showed that patients treated with memantine and riluzole had an average rate of decline on the ALSFRS of -0.73 points per month. Patients who progressed faster than -0.5 ALSFRS points per month had an average baseline CSF tau concentration of 574 pg/ml, while those who progressed slower than -0.5 ALSFRS points per month had CSF tau levels that averaged 298 pg/ml (p = 0.006). After therapy with memantine, patients had a 27% decline in CSF tau levels (p = 0.04) and four patients whose CSF tau dropped to healthy control levels lost only -0.42 ALSFRS points per month. In conclusion, memantine was well tolerated in patients with ALS. Conclusions: Patients receiving memantine and riluzole lost on average -0.73 ALSFRS points per month. Furthermore, levels of CSF tau at baseline could be correlated with how rapidly a patient's disease progressed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20839903?dopt=abstract; April 13, 2010 Presented at 62nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 10-17, 2010, Toronto, Canada Abstract No: P02.243 Todd Levine, Robert Bowser, Nicole Hank, David S. Saperstein Assessment of CSF Biomarkers in a Pilot Study of Memantine in ALS Results: At baseline, CSF levels of tau and pNFH were significantly elevated compared to healthy controls (p = 0.04 and 0.0008, respectively). Baseline levels of p-tau did not differ from healthy controls (p = 0.14). After 18 months of treatment with memantine, average CSF tau levels decreased by 27% (p = 0.04). There was no significant change in pNFH levels (p = 0.26). Memantine reduced the average rate of decline in ALSFRS from 1.07 to 0.56 points per month. Baseline levels of CSF tau and pNFH correlated with whether progression of ALS patients was slower (loss of <0.5 ALSFRS points per month) or faster (loss of > 0.5 ALSFRS points per month) than average (p= 0.005 and 0.002, respectively). Conclusions: Baseline levels of CSF tau and pNFH predicted clinical course. Treatment with memantine significantly decreased CSF tau and slowed disease progression as measured by ALSFRS. CSF measurements of tau and pNFH may serve as biomarkers for ALS. Larger studies of these proteins and of the treatment potential for memantine are warranted. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_P02.243; December 08, 2009 Presented at 20th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2009, Berlin, Germany Abstract# P13 Levine T, Bowser R, Hank N, Saperstein D The Positive Effects of Memantine on Tau Associated Neuronal Degeneration in ALS: An Open Label Pilot Trial Results: Compared to historical controls from other placebo controlled trials that lost an average of -0.90 points per month, the patients followed in this study for 18 months treated with memantine and rilutek lost on average -0.56 points per month. The levels of tau and neurofilament subunit (NF-H) at baseline were significantly higher in our patients with ALS compared to healthy controls. In addition, patients who progressed faster than -0.5 points per month had a higher levels of CSF tau and NF-H at baseline than those who lost less than 0.5 points per month. Preliminary data have indicated that throughout the disease patients exhibit increased levels of CSF tau. In contrast patients in this trial showed a 27% decline in CSF tau after 12 months treatment. Further, patients whose CSF tau levels corrected back to that observed in healthy controls exhibited the slowest decline in ALS disease progression, reducing the rate of decline to -0.42 ALSFRS points per month. Discussion: These data suggest that combination treatment with rilutek and memantine may slow down the disease course in patients with ALS. Further to this, higher levels of CSF tau and NF-H predict a faster rate of progression of the disease. Patients treated with memantine and rilutek who exhibit decreased levels of CSF tau over 12 months showed the most significant slowing of their disease progression. Conclusion: The results of this open label pilot trial suggest that a double blind placebo controlled trial of rilutek and memantine is indicated. It is suggested that CSF tau and NF-H may be valid biomarkers for disease progression. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1681 (Page: 7 of 17); November 03, 2008 (Interim Analysis) Presented at 19th International Symposium on ALS/MND, November 3-5 2008, Birmingham, UK Abstract: SW259 Levine T, Saperstein D, Fyock A, Irizarry K Pilot trial of riluzole and memantine in patients with sporadic ALS Results: All 20 patients have been enrolled in the study.

One patient in the high dose group died leaving 11 subjects available for fi nal analysis while in the low dose group, 2 patients died and 1 withdrew leaving 9 subjects. Serum concentration analysis revealed good compliance. Reported adverse events were similar between the run-in and treatment phases. There was significant slowing of spinal MN loss in the high dose group from -12.4 + or - 3.7 (mean + or - sd)/month at run-in to -5.3 2.2/month during treatment ( p = 0.03 ). When all subjects were combined, they showed a trend of slowing in spinal MN loss that approached signifi cance (-7.8 + or- 2.4/month at run-in vs. -4.2 + or - 1.3/month during treatment, p = 0.05 ). However, none of the functional measures or MRSI revealed a signifi cant treatment effect: ALSFRS-R -1.5 + or - 0.2 vs. -1.2 + or - 0.2, p = 0.22 ; FVC -2.3 + or - 0.7 vs. -2.4 + or - 0.7%, p = 0.96 ; MMT -6.6 + or - 1.2 vs. -7.1 + or - 1.3, p = 0.69 ; MRSI 0.0004 + or - 0.002 vs. 0.0006 + or - 0.004, p = 0.86 . Discussion and conclusions: In this pilot study, we found that memantine at 10 mg bid was effective in slowing spinal MN loss in ALS patients. However, functional measures and UMN degeneration were not signifi cantly improved. The latter could be due to the small sample size. Based on these observations, the fact that memantine is well tolerated and that a previous human study in ALS patients also showed benefi ts, a multicentre full scale clinical trial aimed at recruiting patients at earlier stages of ALS may be warranted. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=2626 (Page: 57 of 165)",Secondary Outcome Measures Motor unit number estimates of hand and foot muscles..

Dropouts (8) and deaths (7) were equally distributed between groups. There was no difference between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcomes measures at 6 months and after 12 months, with intention to treat or per-protocol analysis. Side-effects were comparable between groups. Discussion: The effectiveness of Riluzole, an antiglutamatergic drug, has raised the expectation that other drugs acting in the same pathway could prove efficacious. Memantine is a licensed drug with neuroprotective action in Alzheimer’s disease. This exploratory clinical trial in ALS was negative and does indicate that a larger Phase III is not promising. Conclusions: The negativity if this trial suggests that modulating NMDA receptors by blocking glutamate transmission does not change the rate of motor neuron drop-out in ALS, in particular lower motor neurons. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1681 (Page: 7 of 17)","Secondary Outcome Measures QoL, depression scale, strength (clinical evaluation), forced vital capacity (FVC) [ Time Frame: 12 months ].

The expert panel longlisted 49 drugs identified from ReLiSyR and 54 drugs identified from in vitro screening. Following further evidence generation and synthesis, the expert panel shortlisted 9 drugs and ultimately selected amantadine as the next arm for MND-SMART. Amantadine showed good efficacy and safety across 59 ReLiSyR clinical publications, reduced TDP-43 aggregates on in vitro screening and was predicted to be active on multiple targets associated with MND. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of a systematic data-driven framework to inform prioritisation of candidate drugs for clinical trials in MND, with potential for wider appli- cation across diseases where there is unmet clinical need. Work to broaden the scope of evidence synthesis and increase the efficiency of our framework is ongoing.

Clinical condition of 3 pts deteriorated which could be attributed either to disease progression or stem cell therapy. One patient withdrew from the treatment and one died due to disease progression. Six patients remained stable, no changes in their neurological status have been noticed. Minor adverse events, including neck stiffness, headache, subfebrile state or nausea have been observed. The majority of those side effects were observed shortly after the infusion. One patient was lost to follow-up.

Czaplinski, J. Wojtkiewicz, T. Siwek, A. Habich, M. Barczewska, W. Maksymowicz Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) Transplantation in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Phase I/II Clinical Trial Results No serious side effects of the procedure and no detrimental effects on neurological function were reported. For the entire group (n=11) no difference in the mean rate of change in ALSFRS has been observed (p=0.112). While there was no functional improvement over-time following MSC transplantation for the entire group, in a “responders” group (n=7) a statistically significant decrease in the mean rate of change in ALSFRS has been found (p<0.05). Conclusion Intrathecal administration of autologous bone marrow- derived MSCs into ALS patients is feasible and safe. No clinical benefits were evident for the entire patients group (n=11). However, there was a significant decrease in a mean rate of change in ALSFRS score following intrathecal treatment with MSCs in a “responders” group (n=7). There were no obvious clinical or demographic differences between responders and non- responders groups. In most patients from the “responders” group the beneficial effect was evident only during the first 4-6 months after transplantation suggesting a need for a repeated transplantation. http://ipp.netkey.at/ean/ean2015/index.php?p=recorddetail&rid=bbdf9757501c9d7a72b481dc8944b49e#pres1d343319b620a7d0ad01f8c86d5ea901 (Search woth Abstract ID: F3112)",,TrialTroveID-260001,,,,260001,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,Iii,,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

RMT was significantly reduced over 4 weeks with MEX (combined active therapies) compared to placebo by mixed model analysis (mean +/- SE: placebo = 4.7% +/- 2.2, MEX 300 mg = -2.4% +/- 2.3, MEX 600 mg = 0.8% +/- 2.2, p = 0.039). Dose-dependent reductions of the MEP amplitude was evident at 4 weeks (ratio [95% CI]: placebo = 1.308 [0.249 to 0.965], MEX 300 mg = 0.589 [0.315 to 1.102], MEX 600 mg = 0.490 [0.249 to 0.965], p = 0.013). Accommodation half-time was significantly reduced over 4 weeks with MEX (mean +/- SE: placebo = 5.4ms +/- 2.1, MEX 300 mg = -2.6ms +/- 2.1, MEX 600 mg = -1.2ms +/- 2.3, p = 0.002). Conclusions: 20% of ALS subjects demonstrated cortical inexcitability by TMS at screening, comparable to other recent studies. The reduction of RMT by MEX was unexpected but could result from motor neurons recovering from depolarization block as well as unaccounted medications influencing TMS. The change in MEP amplitude supports a reduction of cortical hyperexcitability by MEX therapy in ALS. The change in accommodation halftime supports reduced excitability of peripheral motor nerve axons with treatment. The study was underpowered due to significant challenges with recruitment and further study is warranted. https://index.mirasmart.com/AAN2020/PDFfiles/AAN2020-002531.html https://n.neurology.org/content/94/15_Supplement/2531; December 5, 2019 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: December 5, 2019 Last Update Posted: December 5, 2019 Recruitment Details Subjects were enrolled at 9 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) centers in the US.

Distad, Jaya Trivedi, Jeremy Shefner, Anuradha Duleep, Richard Barohn, Mazen Dimachkie, April McVey, Alan Pestronk, Andrea Swenson, Eric Macklin, Angela Knox, Katelyn Gilardi, Merit Cudkowicz A Phase 2 Study of Mexiletine in Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: One instance of loss of balance was the only serious adverse event reported among active arm participants. Incidence of nausea and tremor was higher in the MEX 900 mg group, with 32% intolerance at that dose vs. 5% at 300 mg. Rates of decline of ALSFRS-R did not differ from placebo (MEX 300 mg = -0.23 / month [95% CI -1.03,0.56], p=0.56; 900 mg = -0.19 / month [-1.04,0.66], p=0.66). SVC results were similar (MEX 300 mg vs. placebo = 1.74 %-predicted/month [-0.72,4.20], p= 0.16; 900 mg = -0.50 %-predicted/month [-3.33,2.32], p=0.72). Muscle cramp frequency and severity were markedly lower vs. placebo (MEX 300 mg= 69% reduction in frequency, p=0.047, 55% reduction in severity, p=0.08; MEX 900 mg= 84% reduction in frequency, p=0.002, 75% reduction in severity, p=0.005). Conclusions: Mexiletine was safe at both 300 mg and 900 mg doses and well tolerated at the lower dose. Gastrointestinal side effects led to discontinuation of the higher dose. Mexiletine treatment resulted in large dose-dependent reductions in muscle cramp frequency and severity.

Thirteen at p<0.05, and nine at p<0.01. The probability for this is <10-10. The linear mixed effect model showed an average reduction of 1.8 (baseline 6) cramps/day (p=0.001). Analysis of the mean number of cramps also showed a treatment effect (p=0.008), while neither period nor sequence were significant (p=0.39 and p=0.7). Cramp severity The linear mixed effects model showed an average severity reduction of 15/100 (baseline 46) (p=0.011). Fasciculation Severity None of the models found a treatment effect. Conclusions: Mexiletine (150mg BID) is an effective treatment for muscle cramps in ALS, reducing frequency and severity. Mexiletine was ineffective at reducing fasciculations.

Y H Chien 1, S F Peng, C C Yang, N C Lee, L K Tsai, A C Huang, S C Su, C C Tseng, W L Hwu Long-term efficacy of miglustat in paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C Results: Overall, 3/5 patients displayed progressive dysphagia before starting miglustat, and 4/5 showed marked cognitive and/or motor impairment. The mean age at treatment start was 11.6 years, and the median (range) duration of therapy so far is 4 (4.1 to 6.1) years. No treatment dose alterations were required, but therapy was interrupted for 1-3 months at least once in all patients due to supply issues. Swallowing function was stabilised during miglustat therapy, with no significant increase in Han dysphagia scale or aspiration-penetration index scores among four evaluable patients (p > 0.05). Scores on the mini-mental state examination indicated an improvement in cognitive function during the first 3-6 months of miglustat therapy, followed by stabilisation up to 5 years. Ambulatory function remained stable for at least the first 2 years of treatment in most patients, but there was a trend towards deterioration thereafter, possibly related to treatment interruptions. Conclusions: The safety/tolerability profile of miglustat was similar to previous clinical studies, although reports of gastrointestinal disturbances were rare. Overall, miglustat appeared to stabilise key parameters of neurological disease progression. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22476655/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-012-9479-9",Mental [ Time Frame: 12th month ] IQ test or Mini-Mental Status Examination if a full IQ test can not be performed,200802043M NCT01760564 TrialTroveID-229819,"Swallowing [ Time Frame: 12th month ] videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), or NP-C functional disability rating scale if VFSS can not be performed due to safety issue",,,229819,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,Iii,,1,6,2,0,0,0,9,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

MRS study of the effects of minocycline on markers of neuronal and microglial integrity in ALS. Results: Results did not show the expected decrease of N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) in the precentral gyrus, and an increased NAA/Cr ratio in the brainstem suggested neuronal recovery. The myo-inositol (mI)/Cr ratio was unchanged in the precentral gyrus, but increased in the brainstem, indicating a glial reaction. Conclusions: MRS results suggest that minocycline treatment could be beneficial in the early stages of ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832222 http://www.mrijournal.com/article/S0730-725X%2810%2900230-4/abstract; December 01, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 2007 (Suppl 1); 8: 133–139 Magnetic resonance Spectroscopy monitoring of the Effects of minocycline treatment on ALS patients Results: In the precentral gyrus, none of the metabolite ratios showed significant variations following minocycline administration. Larger variations were measured in the brainstem at t56 weeks: NAA/Cr +8.7%; Cho/Cr, +15%; mI/Cr, +20%; Glx/Cr, +6.5%; NAA/mI, 211%; NAA/ (Cr+Cho), +4.1% but only mI/Cr showed a tendency toward statistical significance (p50.06). Discussion & Conclusion: The increase in NAA/Cr in the brainstem suggests that minocycline administration ameliorates in part the neuronal condition since NAA/Cr ratios have been previously reported to decrease by 20% in ALS patients (4). The increase in mI/Cr is indicative of a glial response to the medication.

Gordon; Robert Miller Correlates of quality of life in ALS: Lessons from the minocycline study. Results: Within subjects, MQoL-SIS scores correlated with ALSFRS-R and FVC (p<0.001). MQoL-SIS declined over time (p<0.001) and correlated with the decline of ALSFRS-R (p<0.001). MQoL-SIS tended to improve after initiation of NIV (p =0.07). There was a significant reduction in the rate of MQoL-SIS decline (p<0.001) after initiation of PEG. Subjects with slower QoL decline survived seven months longer than those with faster QoL decline (p<0.01). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that QoL does decline with advancing ALS in subjects who participated in a minocycline trial, that the slope of QoL predicts survival, and that both NIV and PEG have beneficial impacts on QoL. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19551536 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a912651869&db=all; December 01, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Poster no.: P43 Mendoza M, Moore D, Gordon PH, Florence Jm, Verheijde J, Spitalny GM, Doorish C, Montes J, Santos T, Miller RG Falls in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: The ALS Functional Rating Scale and Manual Muscle Testing as Predictors Results: 172 patients (37% of the 470 enrolled) experienced 1 to 12 falls with an average of 2.6 falls per patient for those that had falls during the trial. The median time to first fall was 127 days (range 8 to 404 days) after enrollment. The best predictor of whether a patient would have a fall was baseline ALSFRS-R (p50.019). None of the other factors, including those evaluated 30 to 60 days prior to the fall, were significant predictors of a subsequent fall. The gross motor subscale consisting of three movements (turn, walk and climb; p50.008) was responsible for the significance of the ALSFRS-R as a predictor. This translates to a 16% difference in the probability that the patient will have a fall during the next 12 months when the median is used as a cutpoint. Half (50%) of those with scores below the median (score(7) had one or more falls compared to one-third (34%) of those with scores above the median (scorew7). None of the other ALSFRS-R subscales were significant predictors. Baseline ALSFRS-R was also a significant predictor of the number of falls in patients who had falls (n5172; p50.016). The fine motor movement subscale (handwriting, cutting and dressing; p50.015) predicted number of falls, while other subscales did not. Conclusions: The gross motor subscale of the ALSFRSR may prove useful in predicting incidence of falls in patients with ALS, while the fine motor subscale predicts frequency among those who fall. Whether these scales will be as useful as the timed walk or the Timed Up and Go test, deserves further study. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=921; December 01, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Poster no.: P121 Moore DH, Gordon PH, Spitalny GM, Doorish C, Santos T, Miller RG What endpoint is appropriate for ALS clinical trials? Results: The lme model estimated a pre-randomization slope of 20.81 units/mo for ALSFRS-R in all 412 randomized patients. The post-randomization slope for the placebo group was 21.04 (a 28% increase; p50.002) and for the minocycline group was 21.3 (a 60% increase; pv0.001). The difference in slope change is significant (20.49 for minocycline vs. 20.23 for placebo; p50.005) suggesting that this dose of minocycline led to greater decline in functionality compared to placebo. In contrast, a comparison of post-randomization survival showed no significant difference (median survival for minocycline 1.82 yr vs. 1.72 yr for placebo; p50.90 log-rank test.). Similar, but less significant, results were obtained for FVC and MMT. Thus, in this trial we detected a 22% difference in postrandomization slopes of the ALSFRS-R that did not correlate with a similar difference in survival. Could this difference be attributed to a lack of power for the survival endpoint? A standard power calculation formula with 470 patients recruited over 2 yr and followed 9 months after randomization, indicates 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.66. This is equivalent to a 9 month difference in median survival, much larger than the riluzole effect of 2–3 months. Conclusions: A phase III trial with ALSFRS-R as primary endpoint has excellent power to detect a therapeutic effect. If survival is the endpoint, the trial must be larger and/or longer to achieve the same power. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925; December 01, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Poster number: C76 Gordon PH, Moore DH, Miller RG, Florence JM, Verhiejde JL, Doorish C, Spitalny GM, Hilton JF Results and Implications of a phase III Randomized Controlled Trial of Minocycline Results: The ALSFRS-R deteriorated at a 25% faster rate (p50.005) in the minocycline group than in the placebo group. FVC (15%; p50.11) and MMT (14%; p50.11) tended to deteriorate more rapidly in the treated group. There were no differences in survival, QOL, or serious adverse events, but gastrointestinal (pv0.001) and neurological (p50.02) non-serious adverse events were more common in the minocycline group. Conclusions: High-dose minocycline has a harmful effect on ALS as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale. While the differences were small, and no changes were seen in survival time or quality of life, these results have implications for other trials of minocycline in neurological diseases, and for the current approach to screening potential neuroprotective agents in ALS. The presentation will include additional post hoc analyses that examine potential causes of the worsening due to minocycline, including dosage, adverse events, and interaction with riluzole. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=916; November 05, 2007 Lancet Neurol. 2007 Dec;6(12):1045-53.

Patients on minocycline also had non-significant tendencies towards faster decline in FVC (-3·48 vs -3·01, -1·03 to 0·11; p=0·11) and MMT score (-0·30 vs -0·26, -0·08 to 0·01; p=0·11), and greater mortality during the 9-month treatment phase (hazard ratio=1·32, 95% CI 0·83 to 2·10; p=0·23) than did patients on placebo. Quality-of-life scores did not differ between the treatment groups. Non-serious gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events were more common in the minocycline group than in the placebo group, but these events were not significantly related to the decline in ALSFRS-R score. Interpretation: Our finding that minocycline has a harmful effect on patients with ALS has implications for trials of minocycline in patients with other neurological disorders, and for how potential neuroprotective agents are screened for use in patients with ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17980667 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X3F-4R2HKRS-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a93944c997722a8f184f3c27dc3b1661 Full text available at: http://www.eurekalert.org/images/release_graphics/pdf/TLNMNDdrugfinal.pdf","Secondary Outcome Measures: Changes in manual muscle testing (MMT), forced vital capacity (FVC, percent predicted), quality of life (QOL) and survival.

Three patients randomized to modafinil dropped out because of side effects (tightness in chest (N51), headaches (N52). Twelve patients completed the 4-week trial. Based on clinician ratings, 7 of the 8 modafinil patients had a positive response; all 4 placebo patients were non-responders. At baseline, mean FSS scores were 50.6 and 51.6 for future responders and non-responders, respectively; at week 4 their scores were 29.7 and 44.6 respectively (p5.06). There were trend improvements favoring patients randomized to modafinil on Visual Analog Scale ratings of stamina and sleepiness. In addition, there was a trend reduction in self-rated depressive symptoms among patients on modafinil, although mean scores for both groups were in the ‘‘not depressed’’ range both at baseline and week 4. Conclusions: This small pilot study suggests that modafinil may be helpful for fatigue in patients with ALS. However, ALS patients may be more sensitive to side effects than medically healthy patients or those with other medical conditions, so that an initial low dose and slow dose titration are indicated. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=921","Secondary Outcome Measures Number of ""impaired"" scores on neuropsychological (brief) test battery [ Time Frame: 4 weeks ]. This was an initial plan but the large majority of patients were too impaired (either anarthric or unable to use hands) to complete the tests we had selected so this outcome measure turned out to be unfeasible. Therefore, 0 participants were analyzed. Secondary endpoints include: -The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The FSS is a 9-item scale with a 1-week time frame. It includes statements such as, I was easily fatigued, or fatigue was among my three most disabling symptoms, with a 7-point response format (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). The scale is routinely used in clinical trials of modafinil in the treatment of fatigue in other populations of neurological patients cited above. Total summed scores over 40 (equal to mean item score of 4.5+) are considered to signify clinically significant fatigue and were used as a study inclusion criterion. -The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess daytime sleepiness, a common complaint in ALS. The Role Function Scale includes a list of activities derived from the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36). They were adapted for ALS patients and intended to assess the extent to which fatigue interferes with daily activities. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) items included ratings for energy, stamina, and depression. They were scored on a 10-point scale with higher numbers signifying more of the characteristic. -Depressive symptom severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory II, a 21-item self-report scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores 0-13 suggest absent-to-minimal symptoms, and scores over 19 signify moderate-to-severe symptoms. Other secondary endpoints include Role Function Scale, and visual analog scales.",IRB5178 NCT00614926 TrialTroveID-080449,"Primary Outcome Measures The primary endpoint defining responder versus nonresponder was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI), a standardized assessment tool widely used in clinical psychopharmacology trials as an outcome measure.

As the Principal Investigator recommended, results from the Interim Analysis show that Neurofilament Light Chain (Nfl) protein concentrations in the plasma of participants in its Phase 1 clinical trial do not increase following MPL treatment. Research suggests a correlation between Nfl increases and motor neurone disease progression. Only one patient in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 showed increased Nfl; the other 11 showed no significant change in Nfl, which corresponds to stabilised MND progression... https://www.pharmaust.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Additional-Phase-1-data-suggest-MPL-may-inhibit-motor-neurone-disease-final.pdf; August 9, 2023 [Press Release] [Interim Results] PharmAust Completes Cohort 3 Pharmacokinetics in MND Patients - Elevated Monepantel/Monepantel Sulphone (MPL/MPLS) levels in Cohort 3 data are in line with increasing anti-mTOR pathway activity in MND patients and reducing inflammation associated with neurones... ...- Treatment continues to be well tolerated even after escalation to Cohort 3 and up to 10 months of self-administration - Cohort 3 patient 24 hour PK demonstrate MPLS plasma steady state concentrations increase proportionally to the MPL tablet dose increase from Level 1 - Longer term plasma analysis shows MPLS increases in the plasma by up to 64% in some patients - The final group Cohort 4 has been approved to commence dosing by the trial Safety Committee ...The 24 hour intensive pharmacokinetics data demonstrate the presence of MPL and MPLS in all measured patients. MPL was more rapidly cleared from the plasma of these patients, showing some apparent faster MPLS metabolism. Average MPLS maximum levels following dosing were approximately 1.8 fold increased between Cohort 1 and 3, while calculated steady-state MPLS concentrations (Css) were 2.6 fold increased (see Figure 1)... [Refer to the source URL for Graphical data] PharmAust’s preclinical cancer data suggest MPLS displays similar anti-mTOR pathway activity to MPL, suggesting anti-mTOR pathway activity between Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 has increased. It is hypothesised that decreasing mTOR pathway activity leads to increased autophagy and the removal of misfolded or accumulated proteins associated with motor neurone death. Over the long term and following repeat dosing, MPLS levels were increased by 13-64% for most patients. In contrast, 2 of 6 patients noted overall decreases in average MPLS plasma levels despite the increased dose. Some compliance issues were expected in patients due to poor muscle control associated with tablet swallowing. The patients with these issues may sometimes correlate with reduced MPLS levels. It is noteworthy though that mortality for MND patients is reported to be 34% at one year from diagnosis1. In the current trial patients have been receiving MPL for four to 10 months, with all patients alive and free of Serious Adverse Events and keen to continue MPL treatment.

Measurements include: (1) speech (2) salivation (3) swallowing (4) handwriting (5) cutting food and handling utensils (with or without gastrostomy) (6) dressing and hygiene (7) turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes (8) walking (9) climbing stairs and (10) breathing. Possible scores range from 0 (normal function) to 4 (severe loss of function). Change = (Week 4 score - Baseline score) Treatment-related changes from Baseline in Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Screen (ECAS) at Week 4 [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] The ECAS-cognitive screen is a validated screen comprises 16 items organized into two sub-scales. An ALS-specific sub-scale taps into the cognitive domains of language, verbal fluency, and executive and social functions. A non-ALS-specific sub-scale specifically assesses memory and visuospatial function. The sub-scales of the ECAS-cognitive screen range, respectively, from 0 to 100 and from 0 to 36. Low scores indicate a greater deficit. Change = (Week 4 score - Baseline score) Treatment-related changes from Baseline in slow vital capacity (SVC) [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] A decline in SVC would indicate a decline in respiratory function and is an important indicator of any clinical progression (L/s) Treatment-related changes in urinary p75 levels [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] Urinary p75 level reflect nerve damage and therefore increased levels would act as a proxy to disease progression (ng/mg creatinine) Treatment-related changes in 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] MRI is a method used to investigate and exclude conditions that may mimic motor neuron dysfunction (Tesla) Treatment-related changes in serum neurofilament light (NfL) chain levels [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] Serum NfL chain levels correlate with disease progression, so stable NfL levels would correlate with stable disease (pg/ml) Treatment-related changes in central spinal fluid (CSF) NfL chain levels [ Time Frame: From admission to discharge, up to 6 months ] CSF NfL chain levels correlate with disease progression. Levels in individuals living with MND are 5 to 10 fold higher than those of healthy individuals (pg/ml) Patients from Cohort 1 will continue to be monitored for cognitive function with ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised) being collected monthly.

There is no statistical signifi cant differences. Discussion and Conclusion: Morphine use does not shorten life prognosis in ALS patients. Unfortunately some doctors still have prejudice for morphine use in non-cancer patients. We have to let them know that morphine is safe and effective in palliative care of ALS patients.

Results: A significant decrease was seen in both respiratory rate (from 42.0 + or - 6.0/min to 29.0 +/- 4.0) (P = 0.027) and the intensity of dyspnoea (from 7.5 + or - 1.9 to 1.8 +/- 0.8) (P = 0.027) 120 min after the morphine administration. Neither a significant tcpaCO(2) increase nor a SaO(2) decrease were seen. O(2)-insufflation did not significantly decrease the intensity of dyspnoea. The anxiety of choking correlated highly significantly with the intensity of dyspnoea (r = 0.861, P = 0.028) in all patients. There were no cases of respiratory depression. Discussion: Therapeutic doses of morphine were effective and safe in the management of dyspnoea in ALS patients. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18355309 http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119416316/abstract",,TrialTroveID-128316,,,,128316,Efficacy > Respiratory Function Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,Ii,,2,5,0,0,0,0,7,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

There were 7 men, 2 women. 8 were limb onset and one was bulbar onset. There were six patients that are on either riluzole and edaravone and just one patient was not taking either of the medications. ALSQ-50 had a baseline score of 7.19 and at the one month mark had an improvement to 8.1 in the ALSQ-50 score. Overall, The data shows that there was not a decrease in quality of life, fatigue, and depression during the six month trial, in fact there was a significant improvement in these measurements at the first and three month time mark. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that Poly-MVA is safe and well-tolerated among ALS patients. Overall, the data showed that patients did not have regression in the quality of life, fatigue, and depression over the six month trial period and showed to have improvement in these factors for the first 3 months of being on the supplement. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2022/PDFfiles/AAN2022-001471.html","Secondary Outcome Measures: Change in impact of fatigue [ Time Frame: Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks ] Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a 21-item rating scale with total scores ranging from 0 - 64 where the highest score reflects a greater impact of fatigue on a person's daily activity.

Mean plasma ROS levels were under normal range and significantly increased (pv0.05, ANOVA) in consecutive blood drawings. TAO amounts were significantly lower (pv0.05, Student’s ttest) compared to normal range values and remained almost unchanged after vitamins and/or drug administration. Intracellular SOD1 expression significantly (pv0.05, Student’s t- test) decreased during ALS progression. Discussion: SOD1 activity does not seem to be involved in increased oxidative stress, while evidence suggests that changes of intracellular SOD1 expression may play a role. Pharmacological treatment does not modify increased plasmatic ROS during disease progression and lower levels of plasmatic TAO. Our data show that vitamin/riluzole administration does not modify oxidative stress markers, at least in peripheral tissues.

Comi The CANALS study: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the safety and efficacy on spasticity symptoms of a Cannabis Sativa extract in motor neuron disease patients Results: The study drug was well tolerated, none of the patients included withdrew from the study. We observed a positive trend for improvement of all outcome measures in the active drug arm compared to the placebo group, which reached statistical significance for the MAS mean score (p=0.013) and pain NRS (p=0.013). Patients’ GIC demonstrated a significant subjective improvement in 55% of subjects (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that cannabinoids may represent a valuable option for spasticity treatment in MND patients. Moreover, it may have also additional beneficial effects such as pain relief.

On combination therapy, these patients noted asthenia, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss (10–22 pounds) and decreased ALS FRS-R. Two patients rechallenged with riluzole worsened and discontinued this medication. One of these patients was rechallenged twice with development of weakness and asthenia each time. One patient added BNG to riluzole with consequential weakness that improved with cessation but returned when rechallenged with BNG. Deep vein thrombosis developed in one of four patients on BNG. Discussion and Conclusions: BNG, a poorly characterized concoction of multiple herbs may be associated with subacute onset of asthenia, worsening of ALS clinimetrics, anorexia and weight loss. ALS patients on riluzole may be at risk when starting BNG. A rapid change in clinical status in an ALS patient should lead to investigations of combination therapy with alternative medicines, particularly BNG.

ALSFRS-R,0,"February 1, 2022 [Press release, Post-hoc analysis] Neuvivo Announces Publication of Paper on ALS Drug Candidate NP001 in Peer-Reviewed Journal, Muscle & Nerve - In Large Subset of Patients, NP001 Slowed the Decline in ALSFRS-R Score by 36% and Slowed Vital Capacity Loss by 51% Palo Alto CA, Feb 1, 2022 - Neuvivo today announced the publication of a paper on its lead candidate drug NP001 for the treatment of ALS in the peer-reviewed journal Muscle & Nerve. Authored by 14 of the leading ALS researchers in the world, the study titled: ‘Phase 2B randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pre-specified and post-hoc analysis” showed that NP001 significantly slowed or in some cases, halted, progression of this disease in a subset of patients during a 6-month period. The post-hoc analysis of a Phase 2B trial showed that those ALS patients with C reactive protein (CRP) levels greater than 1.13mg/L (CRP is a marker of inflammation), and between ages 40-65 with symptom onset within 3 years prior, demonstrated a 36% slower rate of decline of ALSFRS-R scores (disease activity score) and a 51% slower rate of decline of respiratory function (vital capacity). In addition, 34% of NP001 treated vs. 11% of placebo patients did not progress over the 6-month studies (p = 0.004); those with higher levels of inflammation showed a 10-fold higher rate of non-progression than placebos with NP001 treatment (p = 0.001). Importantly, the study showed the drug to be safe and well-tolerated. ...The goal of the post hoc combined trial analysis was to identify characteristics of ALS patients responsive to NP001. The analysis combines data from a phase 2A clinical study with a previously unpublished phase 2B clinical trial for treatment of ALS patients with NP001 or placebo. The analysis presented includes data on approximately 300 patients’ data from two 6-month Phase 2 studies... https://www.neuvivo.com/news/neuvivo-announces-publication-of-paper-on-als-drug-candidate-np001-in-peer-reviewed-journal-muscle-nerve/; January 30, 2022 [Post-hoc analyses] Muscle Nerve. 2022 Jan 30. doi: 10.1002/mus.27511.

McGrath MD, PhD Phase 2B randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pre-specified and post-hoc analyses Results: The phase 2B study did not show significant differences between placebo and active treatment with respect to change in ALSFRS-R scores, or VC. The drug was safe and well tolerated. A post hoc analysis identified a 40-65-year-old subset in which NP001-treated patients demonstrated slower declines in ALSFRS-R score by 36% and VC loss by 51% compared to placebo. A greater number of non-progressors were NP001-treated as compared to placebo (p=0.004). Discussion: Although the Phase 2B trial failed to meet its primary endpoints, post-hoc analyses identified a subgroup whose decline in ALSFRS-R and VC scores were significantly slower than placebo. Further studies will be required to validate these findings. This article is protected by copyright.

Miller, Jonathan S. Katz, Gil Block Randomized Phase 2B Trial Of NP001, A Novel Immune Regulator, In ALS Interim Results: 138 subjects were randomized. Clinical features were well matched and there were no significant safety concerns. There were no differences between placebo and treated groups in the primary or secondary outcomes. The change in ALSFRS-R was 4.3 points in 6 months in both groups (p = 0.79), a slower rate of progression than expected for placebo. The median hsCRP values in each group, and the rates of ALSFRS-R progression were similar in each group regardless of CRP. The effects of NP001 on other inflammatory biomarkers, still under analysis, will be discussed at the meeting. Conclusions: NP001 was generally safe and well tolerated, but not effective in this enriched population of patients. The utility of hsCRP as an enrichment biomarker and marker of progression is not supported by these data. The utility of other blood inflammatory biomarker data will be discussed to help move this field forward.

Mean age was 58 years and mean symptom duration was 19 months. 87% of patients had limb onset, 88% had sporadic ALS. Mean baseline ALSFRS-R was 37.0. 67% of patients were taking riluzole. Mean plasma CRP at baseline was 0.4190 mg/dL. Thus far, 86 patients have completed treatment and no patients have discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events. Five patients died from disease progression. The incidence of infusion-related adverse events was low. Conclusions: NP001 was generally safe and well-tolerated. Full results will be available for presentation at the AAN meeting. The effects of NP001 on disease progression and blood inflammatory biomarkers will be discussed. To Access the abstract: 1.

ALSFRS-R,0,"March 30, 2023 [Press Release] New Study of Neuvivo’s NP001 is First to Link Regulation of the Innate Immune System with Respiratory Function in ALS Patients ...In this study, NP001 was shown to have a significant positive impact on respiratory activity by augmenting the natural function of the innate immune system... ...Role of CRP and the Immune System Patients in this vital capacity study were stratified based on plasma levels of a well-known marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP). Levels defined patients as “high CRP” (>1.13mg/L) and “low CRP” (<1.13mg/L) (CRP levels of under 3mg/L are typically considered within normal range, thus a 1.13mg/L level would not generally cause concern). CRP plays an important role in the body clearing misfolded proteins, dying cells and infectious agents as part of a normal innate immune system response. Once stimuli that caused the inflammatory response have been cleared, CRP levels in a healthy person return to normal. An ongoing elevated plasma CRP level indicates that there is disturbance of the cycle, such that the inflammatory response does not resolve. In the study reported by McGrath and colleagues at UCSF and Neuvivo in “Cells”, data showed that patients treated with NP001 and with high CRP were able to better maintain lung function – treated patients had a 64% slower rate of VC loss than patients on placebo. These observations showed that patients with high CRP had stable vital capacity, leading to the possibility that high CRP values may be a biomarker for an immune system that is engaged but has been compromised. Key points presented in the study: NP001-treated patients with high CRP lost 0.75% of vital capacity per month Placebo group patients with high CRP lost 2.1% of vital capacity per month These data represent a 64% slower rate of decline in high CRP patients receiving NP001 (p=0.05) Importantly, plasma TGFB1, a dominant regulator of inflammation, was 95% higher after 6 months in high CRP treated patients compared with controls. (p < 0.02). The 95% increase in plasma TGFB1 that occurred after treatment with NP001 vs placebo and the elevated level of this factor one month after the last dose of treatment, suggests that NP001 may have acted in part to reset the innate immune system... ...Results of this study demonstrate the role of the innate immune system in ALS pathogenesis and importantly, in the maintenance of respiratory capacity... https://www.neuvivo.com/news/new-study-of-neuvivos-np001-is-first-to-link-regulation-of-the-innate-immune-system-with-respiratory-function-in-als-patients/; December 1, 2022 [Press release] Neuvivo’s NP001 for Treatment of ALS Slows Disease Progression Through Regulation of Microbial Translocation - Paper Published in ‘Biomedicines’ Highlights MOA, Links Biomarker Changes to Positive Clinical Outcomes Palo Alto CA, Dec 1, 2022 – Neuvivo today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed paper titled: “Macrophage Targeted Sodium Chlorite (NP001) Slows Progression of ALS through Regulation of Microbial Translocation”. The goal of the biomarker-focused study was to test the relationship between NP001 macrophage-targeted immune regulation and the theory that microbial translocation contributed to ALS progression. Published in the journal ‘Biomedicines’, the peer-reviewed study shows a clear relationship between microbial translocation, inflammation, and disease pathogenesis. Microbial translocation is a process that occurs when bacteria from the gut break through the epithelial barrier and leak into the bloodstream. This initiates a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation now shown to be directly related to the pathogenesis of ALS and potentially other diseases. NP001 treatment has been shown to restore the normal process of resolution in the inflammatory cycle and in so doing, restore the integrity of the epithelial barrier in the gut – halting damaging microbial translocation. In this study, the immunoregulatory activity of NP001 treatment has been confirmed via the normalization of key blood biomarkers... ...Study Details Earlier in 2022, NP001’s activity in two placebo-controlled, 6-month Phase 2 ALS trials was reported. The post hoc analysis defined a large subset of patients between 40-65 years old and with slightly elevated baseline levels of inflammation who were clinically responsive to NP001 treatment. Data showed that NP001 administration was associated with a significantly greater retention of physical function in patients as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale and a significantly greater maintenance of respiratory function. The current study reported in Biomedicines started by defining groups of ALS patients from the Phase 2A NP001 clinical trial that had clear slowing of disease progression compared to controls. Blood biomarkers from the two groups were then measured to determine whether any changes over the 6-month study would be linked to a positive clinical outcome in drug treated patients as compared to controls. Biomarker Data Biomarker data showed that factors associated with harmful microbial translocation (LPS, LBP and HGF), monocyte trafficking (sCD163) and inflammasome activation (IL-18) were significantly decreased in NP001 recipients as compared to placebo over 6 months. Biomarker values that significantly increased were those associated with suppression of inflammation (IL-10, neopterin) and wound healing (EGF). Plasma levels for IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α were within the normal ranges and relatively stable over the 6-month study. A total of 9 biomarkers showed notable changes in the blood of patients treated with NP001 as compared to controls, linking a slowing of ALS disease progression with the regulation of microbial translocation. Patient Subsets “ALS is now recognized as such a heterogeneous disease that in 2019 the FDA published guidelines encouraging treatment developers to identify subsets of patients most responsive to their therapeutic approach,” said Ari Azhir, PhD, CEO, Neuvivo. “This biomarker-based investigation utilized a patient population clinically responsive to NP001 - potentially a large subset - and we saw that macrophage regulation led to slowing, and in some cases halting of disease progression over the 6-month study. NP001 is currently the only treatment in development with a known mechanism of action linking biomarker changes to positive clinical outcomes in a subset of ALS patients. We are working to make treatment available as quickly as possible to people currently living with ALS who may benefit.”... https://www.neuvivo.com/news/neuvivos-np001-for-treatment-of-als-slows-disease-progression-through-regulation-of-microbial-translocation/; November 17, 2022 [Post-hoc analysis] Biomedicines. 2022 Nov 12;10(11):2907 Received: 15 October 2022 / Revised: 4 November 2022 / Accepted: 8 November 2022 / Published: 12 November 2022 Rongzhen Zhang , Paige M Bracci, Ari Azhir , Bruce D Forrest , Michael S McGrath Macrophage-Targeted Sodium Chlorite (NP001) Slows Progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) through Regulation of Microbial Translocation Results: In this post hoc analysis, plasma specimens from baseline and six-month timepoints were analyzed. Compared with baseline values, biomarkers related to MT were significantly decreased (LPS, LPS binding protein (LBP), IL-18, Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), soluble CD163 (sCD163)) in NP001-treated patients as compared to controls, whereas wound healing and immunoregulatory factors were increased (IL-10, Epidermal growth factor (EGF), neopterin) by the end of study. Conclusion: These biomarker results linked to the positive clinical trial outcome confirm that regulation of macrophage activation may be an effective approach for the treatment of ALS and, potentially, other neuroinflammatory diseases related to MT. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36428474/ Full text https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/11/2907 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9687998/; February 1, 2022 [Press release, Post-hoc analysis] Neuvivo Announces Publication of Paper on ALS Drug Candidate NP001 in Peer-Reviewed Journal, Muscle & Nerve - In Large Subset of Patients, NP001 Slowed the Decline in ALSFRS-R Score by 36% and Slowed Vital Capacity Loss by 51% Palo Alto CA, Feb 1, 2022 - Neuvivo today announced the publication of a paper on its lead candidate drug NP001 for the treatment of ALS in the peer-reviewed journal Muscle & Nerve. Authored by 14 of the leading ALS researchers in the world, the study titled: ‘Phase 2B randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pre-specified and post-hoc analysis” showed that NP001 significantly slowed or in some cases, halted, progression of this disease in a subset of patients during a 6-month period. The post-hoc analysis of a Phase 2B trial showed that those ALS patients with C reactive protein (CRP) levels greater than 1.13mg/L (CRP is a marker of inflammation), and between ages 40-65 with symptom onset within 3 years prior, demonstrated a 36% slower rate of decline of ALSFRS-R scores (disease activity score) and a 51% slower rate of decline of respiratory function (vital capacity). In addition, 34% of NP001 treated vs. 11% of placebo patients did not progress over the 6-month studies (p = 0.004); those with higher levels of inflammation showed a 10-fold higher rate of non-progression than placebos with NP001 treatment (p = 0.001). Importantly, the study showed the drug to be safe and well-tolerated. ...The goal of the post hoc combined trial analysis was to identify characteristics of ALS patients responsive to NP001. The analysis combines data from a phase 2A clinical study with a previously unpublished phase 2B clinical trial for treatment of ALS patients with NP001 or placebo. The analysis presented includes data on approximately 300 patients’ data from two 6-month Phase 2 studies... https://www.neuvivo.com/news/neuvivo-announces-publication-of-paper-on-als-drug-candidate-np001-in-peer-reviewed-journal-muscle-nerve/; January 30, 2022 [Post-hoc analyses] Muscle Nerve. 2022 Jan 30. doi: 10.1002/mus.27511.

McGrath MD, PhD Phase 2B randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pre-specified and post-hoc analyses Results: The phase 2B study did not show significant differences between placebo and active treatment with respect to change in ALSFRS-R scores, or VC. The drug was safe and well tolerated. A post hoc analysis identified a 40-65-year-old subset in which NP001-treated patients demonstrated slower declines in ALSFRS-R score by 36% and VC loss by 51% compared to placebo. A greater number of non-progressors were NP001-treated as compared to placebo (p=0.004). Discussion: Although the Phase 2B trial failed to meet its primary endpoints, post-hoc analyses identified a subgroup whose decline in ALSFRS-R and VC scores were significantly slower than placebo. Further studies will be required to validate these findings. This article is protected by copyright.

After 6 months, IL-18 was decreased in most responders, whereas levels increased in the majority of nonresponders and patients who received placebo. Baseline LPS levels, which can induce IL-18, were elevated in 30/32 NP001- treated patients; and decreased in most patients after treatment. In contrast, 19/33 placebo patients were initially LPS negative, however after 6 months, 16 of these 19 were LPS positive. Overall, LPS levels increased in most placebo patients after 6 months (p 0.01). Of interest, all of the NP001 responders had LPS in their plasma, whereas none of the placebo non-progressors had detectable LPS at baseline. Curiously, the patients with undetectable baseline LPS in the placebo group had slower rates of disease progression (-0.66 ALSFRS-R units/month) compared to LPS-positive placebos (-0.9 ALSFRS-R units/month). Discussion and conclusion: NP001 halted disease progression in 27% of patients treated for 6 months, 2.5x the percentage in the placebo group. Two major plasma factors may differentiate NP001 responders from non-responders. The responder population had signifi cantly higher levels of IL-18, a cytokine involved in infl ammation driven cell death, than the non-responders. Additionally, all NP001 responders had detectable LPS in their plasma, and LPS levels decreased in most NP001 patients, consistent with normalization of macrophage function and the mechanism of action of NP001. Placebo patients without detectable LPS may represent a different slowly progressing population. Importantly, elevated IL-18 and presence of LPS, markers indicative of an ongoing neuroinfl ammatory process, may help identify patients likely to benefi t from NP001. Additionally, such markers may help identify different subpopulations in this heterogeneous disorder.

NP001 was generally safe and well-tolerated. NP0012mg/kg showed a consistent pattern of slowing progression as assessed by ALSFRS-R slope or change from baseline by 13 – 21%. Patients with wrCRP greater than median at baseline had greater slowing of disease. NP001 2mg/kg halted disease progression in 27% of patients versus 11% on placebo. Additionally, the majority of responders remained stable during the follow-up period of 3 months without treatment. Conclusions: NP001 2 mg/kg had a modest clinical benefit on slope and unexpectedly halted disease progression in 2.5X as many patients compared to placebo. The absence of progression in most responsive patients, during a 3-month follow-up without treatment, suggests a long-acting effect. Trends in wrCRP support the anti-infl ammatory mechanism of NP001. The unprecedented fi nding that NP0012 mg/kg halted disease in a subset of patients and the overall benefi trisk support further development.

Reduction of MO HLA-DR expression was directly related to the patient’s prior disease progression rate as assessed by ALSFRS-R decline per month (DP rate). Postdosing, significant dose-independent trends in reduction of HLA-DR expression were seen when patients were categorized into three groups: DP rate: < 0.5, > or = 0.5 but < 1, > or = 1 (r 2 = 0.2922, p = 0.0075). NP001 dose-dependently decreased levels of MO CD16 expression (r 2 = 0.2352, p = 0.0129). Additionally, there was no relationship between MO marker response and concomitant riluzole use. Importantly, baseline levels of MO activation defi ned by CD14 co-expression of HLA-DR was directly related to the patient’s DP rate (r = 0.4310, p = 0.0138). A positive correlation was found between levels of CD16 MO expression and DP rate (r = 0.4499, p = 0.0098). These two parameters were independent of each other and when combined showed a more powerful relationship with DP rate in ALS (Multiple R = 0.5734, p=0.0031). Conclusions: Two MO activation/infl ammation markers, HLA-DR and CD16, were independently associated with DP rate in ALS patients, which suggests their potential as biomarkers desperately needed for ALS. Single doses of NP001 reduced levels of both HLA-DR and CD16 MO expression with the degree of reduction dependent on prior DP rate (HLA-DR) and NP001 dose (CD16). Based on the relationship between DP rate and levels of HLA-DR and CD16 expression in ALS, NP001 induced reduction of MO activation/ infl ammation may slow disease progression. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=2626 (Page 58/165)",Secondary Outcome Measures: To explore the effects of NP001 on biomarkers potentially relevant to ALS [ Time Frame: 6 mo. ],NCT01091142 NP001 Single Dose - ALS TrialTroveID-124600,Primary Outcome Measures: Safety and tolerability of NP001 compared to placebo in subjects with ALS [ Time Frame: 6 mo. ],,,124600,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,I,,0,7,0,1,0,0,8,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Glass Analysis of graft survival in a trial of stem cell transplant in ALS Results: Genomic DNA from donor HSSCs was identified in all cases, comprising 0.67–5.4% of total tissue DNA in patients surviving 196 to 921 days after transplantation. In the one female patient a “nest” of cells identified on H&E staining were XY-positive by FISH, confirming donor origin. A subset of XY-positive cells labeled for the neuronal marker NeuN and stem cell marker SOX2. Interpretation: This is the first study to identify human neural stem cells transplanted into a human spinal cord. Transplanted HSSCs survived up to 2.5 years posttransplant. Some cells differentiated into neurons, while others maintained their stem cell phenotype. This work is a proof of concept of the survival and differentiation of human stems cell transplanted into the spinal cord of ALS patients. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.134/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.134/pdf; February 7, 2014 Ann Neurol. 2014 Feb 7. doi: 10.1002/ana.24113.

Intraspinal Neural Stem Cell Injections in ALS Subjects: Phase I Trial Outcomes. Results: The cervical injection procedure was well-tolerated and disease progression did not accelerate in any subject, verifying the safety and feasibility of cervical and dual-targeting approaches. Analyses on outcome data revealed preliminary insight into potential windows of stem cell biological activity and identified clinical assessment measures that closely correlate with ALSFRS-R scores, a standard assessment for ALS clinical trials. Interpretation: This is the first report of cervical and dual-targeted intraspinal transplantation of neural stem cells in ALS subjects. This approach is feasible and well-tolerated, supporting future trial phases examining therapeutic dosing and efficacy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510776 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.24113/abstract;jsessionid=94B959D794E3EF0BC468E8BA9F2BD23A.f02t04 Full Text is Avialable at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.24113/pdf; December 07, 2013 Presented at the 24th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-8, 2013, Milan, Italy Session Type: Platform Communication Session Title: SESSION 8B TRIALS AND TRIAL DESIGN Abstract No.:C77 MAZZINI L , GELATI M , PROFICO D , SGARAVIZZI G , PROJETTI PENSI M , MUZI G , RICCIOLINI C , ROTA NODARI L , CARLETTI S , GIORGI C , SPERA C , FRONDIZZI D, BERSANO E ,NASUELLI N , QUERIN G, MASIERO S , CANTELLO R , SORAR Ù G , BOULIS NM , VESCOVI AL Fetal Neural Stem Cells Transplantation In ALS: Preliminary Results of a Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results: No patients manifested severe treatment-related adverse events. The only treatment adverse event was pain noted immediately after surgery, which was confined to the injection sites and the corresponding dermatomes. This was reversible and disappeared after an average 6 days after surgery. Clinical assessments ranging from 6 to 10 months after transplantation demonstrated no evidence of acceleration of disease progression due to the treatment. Discussion and conclusion: Our preliminary data confirm the procedural safety of this surgical procedure and show no evidence of immediate or delayed toxicity related to human NSC lines from the brain tissue of single fetuses, established under GMP guidelines and in the absence of ethical concerns, due to the origin of the tissue, derived from fetuses deceased by natural death, and its procurement according to the same international guidelines adopted for organ transplantation. We are now broadening the import of this trial, by testing intraspinal injections into the cervical spinal cord (C5 – C6 level), of 12 ambulatory patients.

TRIAL) Results: All patients tolerated the surgical procedure with minimal perioperative or postoperative problems. One patient developed cervical kyphosis as a complication of multilevel laminectomy. There were no adverse events attributable to the cellular injections. Patients were immunosuppressed with a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which resulted in gastrointestinal distress in about a third of the patients. Clinical progression of disease continued in all patients except one, who showed remarkable improvement by both clinical and electrophysiological measures. At the time of this submission (June, 2012), there were four deaths. The technique of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to identify and quantify donor cell DNA in the spinal cord tissue of these deceased patients. The conference presentation will provide up-to-date information on progress as of December 2012. Conclusions: In summary, among patients with ALS, we have demonstrated the tolerability and safety of spinal cord transplantation with neural stem cells. Based on these findings, efficacy testing of this aggressive tactic as a therapeutic option for an otherwise untreatable neurodegenerative disease can now be pursued.

Lumbar Intraspinal Injection of Neural Stem Cells in Patients with ALS: Results of a Phase I Trial in 12 Patients. Results: All patients tolerated the treatment without any long-term complications related to either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells. Clinical assessments ranging from 6 to18 months after transplantation demonstrated no evidence of acceleration of disease progression due to the intervention. One patient has shown improvement in his clinical status, though these data must be interpreted with caution since this trial was neither designed nor powered to measure treatment efficacy. Conclusions: These results allow us to report success in achieving the Phase I goal of demonstrating safety of this therapeutic approach. Based on these positive results we can now advance this trial by testing intraspinal injections into the cervical spinal cord, with the goal of protecting motor neuron pools affecting respiratory function, which may prolong life for patients with ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22415942 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.1079/abstract;jsessionid=453019FB749748D8ADBCA9E55085C2B9.d01t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+17+March+from+10-14+GMT+%2806-10+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance; December 02, 2011 Presented at the Joint Meeting of 22nd International Symposium on ALS/MND and 19th Annual Meeting International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations, November 27-December 2, 2011, Sydney, Australia Session Type: Poster Sessions Session Title: Theme 6 Therapeutic Strategies Abstract ID: P99 Glass J , Boulis N , Polak M , Federici T , Kelly C , Bordeau J , Rutkove S , Hazel T , Johe K , Feldman E First in human phase I trial of neural progenitor cells (Neuralstem) in ALS: Results in the first 12 patients Results: As of early May, 2011, there has been one death, unrelated to either ALS or the clinical trial.

MEPs (2/7) were unchanged from baseline. Clinical evaluation of patients did not reveal any post operative sensory or motor change from their baseline. Conclusions: SSEPs and MEPs were unchanged during the surgery, suggesting unaltered functional integrity of spinal cord. Clinically, there were no new neurological deficits after the surgery. Because there were no losses of intraoperative EPs, and no new postoperative neurological deficits, we cannot comment on whether these EPs are predictive of surgical outcome. We will continue to collect data on the use of EPs during the remainder of this phase 1 study. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN11L_P07.005; April 11, 2011 Presented at the 63rd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 9-16, 2011, Honolulu, HI Abstract No: P01.287 Eva Feldman, Jonathan Glass, Nicholas Boulis, Thais Federici, Meraida Polak, Crystal Kelly, Karl Johe A Phase I, Open-Label, First-in-Human, Feasibility and Safety Study of Human Spinal Cord Derived Neural Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Interim Results: Surgeries are completed on Group A. Subjects are males (37-66 years of age) with limb onset ALS and an average disease duration of 4.4 years. No patients experienced any unexpected serious adverse reactions directly attributable to the procedure. Four of 6 subjects experienced transient neuropathic pain in the spinal dermatomes near the injected level within 24 hours of the procedure, which resolved with no treatment. Three of 6 subjects experienced adverse events secondary to immunosuppression, requiring dose adjustment in 3 subjects and discontinuation in 2. One subject had a pulmonary embolus 19 days post-surgery secondary to an iliac vein thrombosis. All patients remain alive. Conclusions: Direct intraspinal HSCC injections were completed in 6 nonambulatory ALS patients with no unexpected serious adverse events.

(Three of the patients returned to the trial for subsequent treatments in a different region of the spinal cord.) The study found that none of the patients experienced neurological worsening from injections into either the upper (cervical) or lower (lumbar) region of the back, nor was there any evidence of spinal cord injury. The cells also appeared to be safe with no evidence of toxicity. Researchers further noted that, even in the vulnerable ALS spinal cord, serial injections were well-tolerated. They concluded that the approach of starting in the lower region of the spine, where the potential risk to the patient was less, and then progressing upwards, might not be required in future trials, and that this intraspinal delivery technique is an option for treating other neurodegenerative and traumatic spinal cord disorders... http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=203908&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1812360&highlight=",I,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",8,13,4,0,5,0,30,SAFETY,1,0,0,1

Finding: Between Dec 14, 2009, and Nov 2, 2012, we enrolled 24 participants, of whom 20 started their study diet (six in the control group, eight in the HC/HC group, and six in the HF/HC group). One patient in the control group, one in the HC/HC group, and two in the HF/HC group withdrew consent before receiving the intervention. Participants who received the HC/HC diet had a smaller total number of adverse events than did those in the other groups (23 in the HC/HC group vs 42 in the control group vs 48 in the HF/HC group; overall, p=0·06; HC/HC vs control, p=0·06) and significantly fewer serious adverse events than did those on the control diet (none vs nine; p=0·0005). Fewer patients in the HC/HC group discontinued their study diet due to adverse events (none [0%] of eight in the HC/HC group vs three [50%] of six in the control group). During the 5 month follow-up, no deaths occurred in the nine patients assigned to the HC/HC diet compared with three deaths (43%) in the seven patients assigned to the control diet (log-rank p=0·03). Adverse events, tolerability, deaths, and disease progression did not differ significantly between the HF/HC group and the control group. Interpretation: Our results provide preliminary evidence that hypercaloric enteral nutrition is safe and tolerable in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and support the study of nutritional interventions in larger randomised controlled trials at earlier stages of the disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582471 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960222-1/fulltext Full text is avialable at: http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673614602221.pdf?id=eaaE-M1vPaz5M7it9drsu; Decmeber 6, 2013 Presented at the 24th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-8, 2013, Milan, Italy Session Type: POSTER SESSION A Session Title : ""THEME 2 RESPIRATORY AND NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT"" Abstract No.: P39 WILLS A , HUBBARD J , MACKLIN E , MAHONEY K , GRASSO D , SOODOO N , LISI J , SIMPSON E , LAWSON R , YU H , CUDKOWICZ M Initial Results from the High Fat/high Calorie versus Optimal Nutrition in ALS clinical trial Results: A total of 28 participants were screened and 24 participants were enrolled between December 2009 and October 2012. Seven participants were randomized to the control diet, nine to the high calorie diet, and eight to the high fat/high calorie arms, although four participants (1, 1, and 2, respectively) withdrew after randomization but before starting study diet. Baseline demographics were similar among the three study arms. Four participants (3, 0, and 1, respectively) discontinued the study diet due to adverse events. Overall, the tolerability rate was 43% vs. 89% vs. 63%. There were four deaths during the study, all due to respiratory failure: 3 in the control, 0 in the high calorie, and 1 in the high fat/high calorie arm. No deaths were considered related to study diet. There were 42 AE and 9 SAE in the control, 24 AE and 0 SAE in the high calorie and 49 AE and 3 SAE in the high fat/high calorie group. The most common AE were gastrointestinal (71% vs. 44% vs. 63% of participants experiencing at least one AE) and most common SAE were pulmonary (43% vs. 0% vs. 25%). Conclusion: This is the first clinical trial conducted in ALS patients who require percutaneous enteral nutrition. The early results of this study demonstrate signifi cant barriers to enrolment and a high frequency of pulmonary and gastrointestinal AE.

RESULTS : Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4?+ or -?10.8?years) were included. The confirmatory analysis of the primary outcome survival showed a survival probability of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27-0.51) in the placebo group and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.25-0.49) in the HCFD group, both after 28 months (point in time of the last event). The hazard ratio was 0.97, 1-sided 97.5% CI = - inf to 1.44, p =?0.44.

Sixty-nine treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported: 13 were considered possibly related to drug, 2 probably related, 21 unlikely related and 33 were considered unrelated to drug. The two probably related TEAEs occurred in the control group. Among the possibly related TEAEs, 1 occurred in the control group, 6 in the 125 mg group, 3 in the 250 mg group and 3 in the 500 mg group. These TEAEs were mild (n555), moderate (13) or severe (2) in intensity. The most frequent TEAEs (n>4 episodes) were asthenia (12 episodes, 9 on TRO19622), diarrhoea (6 episodes, 4 on TRO19622), constipation (3 episodes, 1 on TRO19622) and muscle spasms (4 episodes, 3 on TRO19622). The frequency, severity, duration and time to TEAEs did not increase with dose. One serious adverse event , a deglutition pneumonia, was reported in the 500 mg group and assessed as unrelated to treatment. No relevant changes in vital signs, ECG parameters, laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed at any time and in any dose group. As anticipated in a one month study, there was no change in ALSFRS-R and Slow Vital Capacity. Day 15 and Day 30 TRO19622 plasma trough concentrations were similar suggesting that steady state had been reached. Median male and female trough concentrations were 512 and 742 ng/mL (125 mg group), 979 and 1685 ng/mL (250 mg) and 2965 and 3310 ng/ mL (500 mg). The highest trough concentration, 5780 ng/ mL was observed on day 15 at 500 mg. There was no statistically significant gender effect at all three TRO19622 doses (pw0.32, Mann-Whitney) at day 15. Conclusion: In conclusion TRO19622 up to 500 mg QD per os as add-on to RLZ 50 mg BID for one month was very well tolerated in ALS patients. Target plasma concentrations, based on in vitro/in vivo models, were obtained at the 250/500 mg doses. Higher trough TRO19622 plasma concentrations were observed in ALS patients vs healthy volunteers, either due to co-administration with food/RLZ or to some unknown factor specific to ALS patients.

Ludolph Neurofilament light and heterogeneity of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: development and validation of a prediction model to improve interventional trials Results: Among the parameters provided, the NfL levels (P < 0.001) and the interaction with site of onset (P < 0.01) contributed significantly to the prediction, forming a robust NfL prediction model (R = 0.67). Model application in the trial cohorts confirmed its applicability and revealed superiority over lead-in and ?FRS-based approaches. The NfL model improved statistical power by 61% and 22% (95% confidence intervals: 54%-66%, 7%-29%). Conclusion: The use of the NfL-based prediction model to compensate for clinical heterogeneity in ALS could significantly increase the trial power. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34433481/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390195/ https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-021-00257-y; January 21, 2014 Eur J Neurol. 2014 Jan 21. doi: 10.1111/ene.12344.

Results: Safety: No SAE as well as no major issues in safety assessment were reported. Sixty-nine Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) were reported: 18 were considered possibly related to the investigated medicinal product (IMP), 22 unlikely related and 27 were considered unrelated to the IMP. Among the possibly related TEAEs, seven occurred on placebo; two on TRO 19622 50 mg dose; none on TRO 19622 150 mg; two on 250 mg dose and seven on TRO 19622 500 mg dose. These TEAEs were mild (48) or moderate (21) in intensity. None was rated as severe. The most common TEAEs (n> 4 episodes) were diarrhoea (nine episodes), headache (seven episodes), constipation (four episodes), pharyngitis (four episodes) and back pain (four episodes). There was no correlation between occurrence of TEAEs and dosage. No relevant change in vital signs, ECGs parameters, laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed after repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics: TRO19622 absorption and elimination were slow after oral dosing whatever the dosage: tmax of about 10 h and TRO19622 concentrations measurable up to 19 days after dosing. Mean terminal elimination half-life was about 120 h and comparable between doses. On day 1 when the dose increased in a ratio of 3, 5 and 10 (from 50 to 150, 250 and 500 mg, respectively), Cmax increased in a ratio of 2.2, 4.4 and 10.2 and AUC0-t increased in a ratio of 2.1, 4.6 and 10.8. At steady-state, reached on day 11 whatever the group, Cmax increased with dose in a ratio of 2.1, 7.2 and 12.2 and AUC0-t increased in a ratio of 2.0, 6.5 and 11.6. Mean accumulation ratios of Cmax and Ctrough observed between day 1 and day 11 were about 4. Plasma PK profiles were similar between subjects and across doses, the coefficient of variation of Cmax and AUC0-t were between 21 and 47% on day 11. Conclusion: TRO19622 repeated administration up to 500 mg per day was well tolerated in healthy volunteers. PK results suggest that target effective concentrations derived from in vitro and several in vivo pre-clinical models can be reached at a QD dose of 250 mg and above. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14660820600978012 [URL has expired] http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=601",,TrialTroveID-080017,,,,80017,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,I,,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

No serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred during the study. Acute phase reaction-type ADRs, as evidenced by elevated inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-8, and calcitonin) and constitutional symptoms (fever, pain, nausea, and/or vomiting) emerged 12-24 h following doses ≥0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa. Three patients experienced hyperbilirubinemia. The study was terminated after a patient dosed at 1 mg/kg exhibited severe hyperbilirubinemia; he was subsequently diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome. Conclusion: The maximum tolerated dose of olipudase alfa in adults with NPD B was 0.6 mg/kg.

Treatment of severe drooling with botulinum toxin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease: Efficacy and possible mechanisms. Results. Drooling and flow were reduced (P < 0.05) 2 weeks after treatment, without side-effects. The maximal reductions during the observation period were 40% for drooling and 30% for flow. There was a systematic variation in flow during the observation period, with an initial decrease and then an increase followed by a second decrease. Amylase activity and total protein concentration generally increased with decreasing flow (P < or = 0.03). Conclusion: Inhibition of acetylcholine release from postganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings by injection of BTX-A into salivary glands seemed useful for secondary sialorrhoea, although cyclic variations in flow may occur, possibly due to transitory sprouting and regeneration. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21198339 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016357.2010.545035",,TrialTroveID-140851,,,,140851,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Results: Botox significantly improved the degree of sialorrhea and a drooling impact score and, by inference, the quality of living, in over half of the patients with bulbar ALS and severe sialorrhea. The beneficial effect of Botox lasted for at least 2 months in those who responded. No major adverse effects were noted. Conclusion: Local injection of a small dose of Botox into the parotid glands can control sialorrhea and potentially improve living quality in some patients with bulbar ALS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&uid=16583370&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112573608/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0",,TrialTroveID-079862,,,,79862,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Updates on the Investigator-initiated Phase 2 Study in Patients with ALS Kringle Pharma, Inc. announces that it has received the results of the investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical study evaluating its recombinant human HGF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from Tohoku University, located in Miyagi, Japan. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KP-100IT in a total of 46 ALS patients with Japan ALS Severity Classification of Grade 1 or 2, within 30 months of onset of the disease. KP-100IT or placebo was administered intrathecally once every two weeks, and the change in ALSFRS-R score at the 24-week treatment period was evaluated as a primary endpoint. As a result, there was no statistically significant difference between the KP-100IT group and the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were observed in the pre-specified secondary endpoints between the two groups. On the other hand, in the KP- 100IT administered group, slowing of the disease progression was observed in some cases and further detailed analysis is required to interpret the results of this study. Regarding safety, the incidence of adverse events was similar between the KP-100IT and placebo groups, confirming that the intrathecal administration of KP-100IT was well-tolerated.

Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Intrathecal Injection of Recombinant Human HGF (KP-100) in Subjects With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Phase I Trial. Results: With single-dose administration, the mean half-life of KP-100 in the cerebrospinal fluid was 1.2 to 1.4 days, with its maximum concentration increasing in a dose-dependent manner. With multiple-dose administration, the trough KP-100 concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid generally remained constant for any dose, despite multiple dosing. There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or device malfunctions leading to discontinuation. In all subjects, plasma KP-100 concentrations were <1 ng/mL, or below the lower limit of detection at all time points of measurement. Anti-KP-100 antibody was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid or plasma specimens from any of the subjects throughout the KP-100 dosing period. Conclusions: These results suggest that KP-100, as well as the device used to administer it, is safe and tolerable.

Change from placebo condition in Caregiver’s rating of patient’s side effects and mood change associated with repeated acute administration of oxytocin 3. Change from placebo condition in variation of oxytocin peripheral levels associated with acute administration of oxytocin 4. Change from placebo condition in variation of gender-related behavioral differences associated with acute administration of oxytocin Secondary end point(s) With respect to the secondary measures, we anticipate the following endpoints: • No difference between oxytocin and placebo with respect to frequency of sides effects indicated by the participant on a checklist on each testing day • Increase of positive affect as reported by the caregiver. • Increase of peripheral oxytocin concentration after oxytocin treatment • Stronger effect of oxytocin in males than females (because the levels are lower in baseline) Regarding the measurement of oxytocin concentrations, before and after the IMP administration, patients’ 9 ml blood samples will be collected and analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography method.

Safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. Results Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 1, 2013, we recruited 307 patients, of whom 303 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=151) or ozanezumab (n=152). The adjusted mean of the joint-rank score was -14·9 (SE 13·5) for the ozanezumab group and 15·0 (13·6) for the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference of -30·0 (95% CI -67·9 to 7·9; p=0·12). Overall, reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were similar between the treatment groups, except for dyspepsia (ten [7%] in the ozanezumab group vs four [3%] in the placebo group), depression (11 [7%] vs five [3%]), and diarrhoea (25 [16%] vs 12 [8%]). Respiratory failure was the most common serious adverse event (12 [8%] vs seven [5%]). At week 60, the number of deaths was higher in the ozanezumab group (20 [13%]) than in the placebo group (16 [11%]), mainly as a result of respiratory failure (ten [7%] vs five [3%]). Two deaths were considered related to the study drug (bladder transitional cell carcinoma in the ozanezumab group and cerebrovascular accident in the placebo group). Conclusions: Ozanezumab did not show efficacy compared with placebo in patients with ALS. Therefore, Nogo-A does not seem to be an effective therapeutic target in ALS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28139349 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(16)30399-4/abstract","Secondary Outcome Measures : Change From Baseline in the ALSFRS-R Total Score at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 48 ] The rate of decline was estimated by the change from Baseline in ALSFRS-R. The monthly slope for the ALSFRS-R score (i.e., the monthly rate of decline) was calculated as change from Baseline in the ALSFRS-R score at the last visit for that treatment period divided by the study day at the last visit for that treatment period /30.4. The Week 0 (Visit 2) value was considered to be the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the derived Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. The ALSFRS-R was a quickly administered (5 min) ordinal rating scale used to determine a participant's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There were 12 questions, graded by the participant 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing. Rate of Decline Over Week 48 in the ALSFRS-R Total Score [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 48 ] The rate of decline was estimated by the change from Baseline in ALSFRS-R. The monthly slope for the ALSFRS-R score (i.e., the monthly rate of decline) was calculated as change from Baseline in the ALSFRS-R score at the last visit for that treatment period divided by the study day at the last visit for that treatment period devided by 30.4. The Week 0 (Visit 2) value was considered to be the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the derived Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. The ALSFRS-R was a quickly administered (5 min) ordinal rating scale used to determine a participant's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There were 12 questions, graded by the participant 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing. Change From Baseline in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 48 ] SVC was measured by using a validated spirometer. Three SVC measurements were performed for each participant at each assessment provided the difference from the second trial (if arranged by the numerical value) was not greater than 10%. If the difference between the best and the next best (based on the largest numerical value) SVC value from the first three trials was greater than 10%, additional trials (up to 5 in total) could have been performed. The Week 0 (visit 2) value was considered to be the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the derived Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. A mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment by visit, Baseline SVC, Baseline SVC by visit, riluzole use. and country group was used for the analysis. Change From Baseline in Muscle Strength as Measured by Hand Held Dynamometry (HHD) Score at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 48 ] The HHD is a device placed between the hand of the practitioner and the tested body part and provides a quantified measurement of muscle strength. Each muscle was tested twice, and both values were recorded. Additionally, a third trial could have been performed if the variability between the first two trials was greater than 15 % or if the rater thought that one of the first two trials was not valid. The Week 0 (Visit 2) value was considered to be the Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline for each muscle group was calculated as 100*(HHD score minus the Baseline score) divided by the Baseline score. The average percent change was the mean percent change across the muscle groups that were non-missing/non-zero at Baseline. MMRM adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment by visit, number of non-missing/non-zero muscle groups at Baseline, number of non-missing/non-zero muscle groups at Baseline by Visit, riluzole use, and country group was used for the analysis. Number of Clinical Global Impression-improvement Scale (CGI-I) Responders at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Week 48 ] The CGI-I scale is a single observer-rated item measuring global improvement relative to Baseline. The CGI-I score is rated on a 7-point scale, from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Participant status at Baseline was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale (CGI-S), which is a 7-point scale (1: normal, not at all ill; 7: most extremely ill) used to rate the severity of the participant's illness. Participants achieving a score of 1-4 in the CGI-I at Week 48 were considered to be responders. A a logistic regression adjusted for CGI-S at Baseline, riluzole use, and world region was used for the analysis. Overall Survival at Week 48 and Week 60 [ Time Frame: Week 48 and Week 60 ] Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death or censoring at the time point of analysis, whichever comes first. Kaplan Meier estimates at Week 48 were evaluated at Day 344. A participant was considered to have completed if he/she was censored at Day 344. Kaplan Meier estimates at Week 60 were evaluated at Day 428. A participant was considered to have completed if he/she was censored at Day 428. Confidence intervals were estimated using the Brookmeyer Crowley method. Results are shown as the estimated percentage of participants alive at Weeks 48 and 60. Week 48: Only on-treatment data (data within 21 days of the last dose) were analyzed. Week 60: Including off treatment data (data after 21 days after the last dose) were analyzed. Progression-free Survival at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Week 48 ] Progression-free survival at Week 48 is defined as the time from randomization to progression (decline of at least six points on the ALSFRS-R from Baseline) or death or censored at Week 48, whichever comes first. Kaplan Meier estimates at Week 48 were evaluated at Day 344. A participant was considered to have completed if he/she was censored at Day 344. Confidence intervals were estimated using the Brookmeyer Crowley method. Results are shown as the estimated percentage of participants alive and without disease progression at Week 48. Change From Baseline in the EuroQol 5 Dimensions-5 Level Short Form (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 48 ] A utility score for each participant was calculated based on the value set for England. The Week 0 (Visit 2) value was considered to be the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the derived Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. The EQ 5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). . For each of these dimensions, the participant self assigned a score: 1 (no problems); 2 (slight problems); 3 (moderate problems); 4 (severe problems); 5 (extreme problems).Minimum score on scale was 1 and maximum score was 5 for each dimension. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Change From Baseline in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire-40 (ALSAQ-40) Total Score at Week 48 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 48 ] The ALSAQ-40 is a disease specific health status assessment for individuals with ALS/motor neuron disease. The ALSAQ-40 is comprised of 40 questions measuring 5discrete dimensions of health status that are affected by the disease: physical mobility (10 items); activities of daily living and independence (10 items); eating and drinking (3 items); communication (7 items); emotional reactions (10 items). Participants were asked to indicate the frequency of each event by selecting one of five options (Likert scale: 0-4): never/rarely/sometimes/often/ always or cannot do at all. The total score (minimum possible score=0, maximum possible score=160) was calculated by adding the five domain scores. A low score indicates a better health state. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the derived Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. A mixed-model repeated measures adjusted for treatment, Visit, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline ALSAQ-40 total score was used for the analysis.

Function is assessed using change from Baseline in the ALSFRS-R total score. To calculate joint rank scores, every participant was compared with all other participants in a pair wise manner and assigned a score of -1, 0 or 1 based on their relative outcomes. A subject's joint rank score is the sum of their scores across the pair wise comparisons. The .

Results: Overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01-15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. The majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. Six serious AEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. No study drug-related patterns were identified for ECG, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. One subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. PK results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. No apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. Immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle. Conclusions: In conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action.

(Nasdaq: PASG), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company focused on improving the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, today announced initial safety and biomarker data from three Cohort 1 patients in the ongoing global Phase 1/2 upliFT-D clinical trial evaluating PBFT02, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery gene therapy for the treatment of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with granulin (GRN) mutations... ...The upliFT-D clinical trial evaluates PBFT02 as a single dose delivered via intra-cisterna magna (ICM) injection. PBFT02 uses an AAV1 viral vector to deliver a functional copy of the GRN gene encoding PGRN to a patient's cells. Topline interim results from first three patients in the uplift-D clinical trial Safety (patient follow-up up to six months) - Dose 1 of PBFT02 was generally well-tolerated in patients 2 and 3, who received an enhanced steroid regimen following protocol amendment. - No serious adverse events (SAEs). - All treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in severity. - No evidence of clinically significant immune response, hepatotoxicity or safety related imaging abnormalities. - Patient 1 received a low level of immunosuppression (60 mg oral prednisone for 60 days) and experienced two SAEs that were both asymptomatic and consistent with an immune response. - Following patient 1, the protocol was amended to increase the steroid regimen (1,000 mg IV methylprednisolone on days 1-3 followed by 60 mg oral prednisone through day 60) for patients 2 and 3. - No evidence of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) toxicity, as measured by nerve conduction studies, and no complications were observed related to ICM administration across any of the three patients. Biomarkers - Dose 1 of PBFT02 treatment resulted in a 3.6 to 6.6-fold increase in CSF PGRN at day 30 (n=3) relative to baseline. CSF PGRN increased to supraphysiologic levels of 10.7 to 17.3 ng/mL at day 30, exceeding the range found in healthy adult controls of 3.3 to 8.2 ng/mL (n=61). - CSF PGRN remained at supraphysiologic levels at six months with a concentration of 27.3 ng/mL (n=1). Plasma PGRN levels remained below levels found in healthy adult controls through the available follow-up period across all patients... https://www.passagebio.com/investors-and-news/press-releases-and-statements/news-details/2023/Passage-Bio-Announces-Promising-Initial-Data-From-Phase-12-Clinical-Trial-of-PBFT02-in-FTD-GRN-and-Updated-Strategic-Priorities/default.aspx","CSF progranulin levels; serum and Nfl; disease progression biomarkers; clinical outcome measure; and others 1, 6 months CSF PGRN levels Secondary Outcome Measures: Change from baseline in FTD clinical domains as assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center frontotemporal lobar degeneration domains (CDR Plus NACC FTLD) [ Time Frame: From baseline to 2 years (multiple visits) ] Assess changes in cognitive, behavioral and language domains using the CDR Plus NACC FTLD Change from baseline in neurocognitive and other assessments [ Time Frame: From baseline to 2 years (multiple visits) ] Assess changes using the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT).

Koch, PALMITOYLETHANOLAMIDE COMBINED WITH LUTEOLINE IN FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA PATIENTS (PEA-FTD): A PHASE 2 RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL Results: A total of 93 patients were screened of which 48 were randomized (25 to co-ultraPEAlut and 23 to placebo). Mean age of patients was 63.218.4 and 23 (47.9%) were female. 45 patients (93%) completed the treatment. Patients in the co-ultraPEAlut group showed less decline for the primary outcome measure (CDR plus NACC FTLD) as compared to patients treated with placebo. The estimated mean rates change (WO-W24) in CDR plus NACC FTLD score was 0.6 for co- ultraPEAlut [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.2 to 1)] and 1.4783 for placebo group [95% CI (1.062 to 1.895)]. Estimated mean change in ADCS- ADL score was -1.8 for the co-ultraPEAlut (95% CI, - 3.664 to 0.0641) and -7.39 for the placebo group (95% CI -9.335 to -5.4478). Estimated mean change in SAND scores was -3.987 for the co-ultraPEAlut (95% CI, -7.75 to -0.223) and -10.349 for the placebo group (95% CI, -14.33 to -6.367). No significant effect of co-ultraPEAlut treatment was found on other secondary outcome measures. Conclusion: Co-ultramicronized Palmythoilethanolamide combined with Lutheoline exhibits encouraging efficacy in slowing down the progression of cognitive and functional symptoms in FTD patients. These findings warrant further investigation and hold promise for the development of effective therapeutic interventions for FTD. https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/files/files/CTAD%20ABSTRACT%202023%20oct%2024_compressed.pdf; August 18, 2020 J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;76(4):1297-1308.

Effects of Palmitoylethanolamide Combined with Luteoline on Frontal Lobe Functions, High Frequency Oscillations, and GABAergic Transmission in Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia Interim Results: Treatment with PEA-LUT was associated with an improvement in NPI and FAB scores. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a restoration of LICI, in particular at ISI 100 ms, suggesting a modulation of GABA(B) activity. TMS-EEG showed a remarkable increase of TMS-evoked frontal lobe activity and of high-frequency oscillations in the beta/gamma range. Conclusion: PEA-LUT could reduce behavioral disturbances and improve frontal lobe functions in FTD patients through the modulation of cortical oscillatory activity and GABA(B)ergic transmission. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32623398/ https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200426","Secondary Outcome Measures : Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Battery to evaluate executive functions Screening for aphasia in Neurodegeneration (SAND) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] battery to evaluate language functions Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] battery to evaluate activities of daily living Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] battery to evaluate global cognition Long intracortical inhibition (LICI) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] TMS protocol to evaluate GABA(B)ergic transmission Sort intracortical inhibition (SICI) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] TMS protocol to evaluate GABA(B)ergic transmission TMS-EEG [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] power in beta-gamma band to evaluate prefrontal cortical oscillatory activity Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Battery to assess behavioral changes Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Battery to evaluate global cognition changes Frontal Behavioural Inventory [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Battery to evaluate behavioural functions Secondary outcome measure included the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration (SAND), Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory scale (NPI),Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R).",NCT04489017 PEA-FTD SPE.107 TrialTroveID-380926,Primary Outcome Measures : Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Battery to assess behavioral changes The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change at 24-weeks from baseline in the CDR Dementia Staging Instrument from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and Frontotemporal lobar degeneration modules-sum of boxes (CDR plus NACC FTLD - SOB).,A total of 93 patients were screened of which 48 were randomized (25 to co-ultraPEAlut and 23 to placebo)....45 patients (93%) completed the treatment... https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/files/files/CTAD%20ABSTRACT%202023%20oct%2024_compressed.pdf,Activities of Daily Living Cognitive function test Frontal Assessment Battery Mini Mental State Examination Neuropsychiatric Inventory,380926,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments,,Ii,"Completed, Outcome unknown",4,0,6,0,0,0,10,FUNCTIONAL,0,0,0,1

Results: At the end of the study, after 547 days of follow-up, 103 patients (51.7%) in the pentoxifylline group and 120 (59.7%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted risk 1.28, p = 0.107; adjusted risk 1.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, analysis of secondary outcome functional variables did not show the same negative effect of the drug. The most common adverse reactions were nausea, dysphagia, and flushing, all reversible after stopping the drug. Conclusions: Pentoxifylline is not beneficial in ALS and should be avoided in patients treated with riluzole. The discrepancy between survival and measures of functional changes urges caution in equating these end points in phase III trials, and suggests that both survival and function should be used in phase III trials. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16401852&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/1/88",Secondary outcomes: Rates of deterioration of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Respiratory and muscle strength.,N0059115937 TrialTroveID-079170,"The primary intention-to-treat analysis was the survival comparison of drug vs placebo, assessed before (log-rank test) and after adjustment (Cox model) for predefined prognostic factors.

Of 65 patients included, 18 of 22 patients randomized to placebo (82%), 14 of 22 patients randomized to 4 mg perampanel (64%), and 7 of 21 patients randomized to 8 mg perampanel (33%) completed the trial. There was a significant difference in the change of ALSFRS-R scores [- 8.4 (95% CI - 13.9 to - 2.9); p = 0.015] between the placebo and the perampanel 8 mg group, primarily due to worsening of the bulbar subscore in the perampanel 8 mg group. Serious AEs were more frequent in the perampanel 8 mg group than in the placebo group (p = 0.0483). Conclusion: Perampanel was associated with a significant decline in ALSFRS-R score and was linked to worsening of the bulbar subscore in the 8 mg group. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34191081/ Fulltext available at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00415-021-10670-y; November 5, 2020 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 21, Issue supplement 2, November 2020 Presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2020, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 5, 2020 Abstract No.: CLT-26 Professor Hitoshi Aizawa, Haruhisa Kato, Koji Oba, Takuya Kawahara, Yoshihiko Okubo, Tomoko Saito, Makiko Naito, Professor Makoto Urushitani, Professor Akira Tamaoka, Kiyotaka Nakamagoe, Kazuhiro Ishii, Professor Takashi Kanda, Professor Masahisa Katsuno, Naoki Atsuta, Yasushi Maeda, Makiko Nagai, Professor Kazutoshi Nishiyama, Hiroyuki Ishiura, Professor Tatsushi Toda, Akihiro Kawata, Professor Koji Abe, Professor Ichiro Yabe, Ikuko Takahashi-Iwata, Professor Hidenao Sasaki, Hitoshi Warita, Professor Masashi Aoki, Professor Gen Sobue, Professor Hidehiro Mizusawa, Yutaka Matsuyama, Tomohiro Haga, Professor Shin Kwak A Phase II Clinical Trial of Perampanel for Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: Between April 2017 and January 2020, 65 patients were randomized to perampanel 4 mg (n=22), 8 mg (n=21), or placebo groups (n=22). There was a significant difference (-8.4 [95% confidence interval -13.9–-2.9]; p=0.015) between the placebo and the perampanel 8 mg group, primarily due to worsening of the bulbar subscore in the perampanel 8 mg group. Changes in MMT grading from baseline to week 48 showed no significant difference among the three groups except that the deterioration in MMT grading of the hamstring muscles on the left side was significantly smaller in the 8 mg perampanel group than in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were significantly more frequent in the perampanel 8 mg group than in the placebo group (p=0.0483). The most common event was dysphagia requiring gastrostomy. Discussion: Perampanel did not prevent the decline of ALSFRS-R scores in patients with SALS after 48 weeks in a dose-related fashion probably because of significant decline in the bulbar subscore in the high-dose group. Since there was a favourable effect of perampanel on some muscles of the lower extremities as well as considerable variability of change in the ALSFRS-R score after 48 weeks from baseline among the individuals in each group, including virtually non-progressive participants in the perampanel groups, the clinical benefit of perampanel in perampanel-responsive SALS patient needs further study.

Tariot, V. Abler, S. Pathak, B. Coate, M.E. Turner; PIMAVANSERIN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AND CARDIOVASCULAR/ SAFETY IN PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Results: Among the 292 and 282 patients treated with pimavanserin and placebo, respectively, median ages were 76.0 and 78.0 years, 91.8% and 93.5% were white. The majority of the patients in both groups had vascular disorders (61.3% of pimavanserin and 63.1% of placebo) and 45.5% and 48.2%, had hypertension, respectively. Mean (SE) change in QTcF from baseline to last-postbaseline assessment was 6.2 ms (1.03) in the pimavanserin group and −1.1 ms (1.01) in the placebo group. Change from baseline to last post-baseline assessment in QTcF >500 ms and QTcF >60 ms was reported in 0.4% of the pimavanserin group and none of the patients in the placebo group. Overall, the number of patients with cardiovascular AEs were numerically higher for pimavanserin (6.2%) than placebo (4.3%). Electrocardiogramassociated treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥1% were prolonged QT (1.4% pimavanserin, 1.4% placebo). Other cardiovascular AEs reported in ≥1% were peripheral edema (3.1% pimavanserin, 1.1% placebo). There were no reports of torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia. There was one fatal case of cardiopulmonary failure reported in the placebo group. Conclusions: Baseline characteristics demonstrated that many of these patients with AD were older and comorbidities were common, including vascular disorders and hypertension. These higher-risk characteristics underscore the importance of a thorough understanding of the safety of medications used in these patients. Data from this large group of patients with AD shows that pimavanserin prolonged the QTcF interval by an average of 6.2 ms and resulted in a change from baseline in elevated QTcF intervals (ie, >60 or >500 ms) in less than 0.5% of patients, each. Results were consistent with previous findings in AD and prescribing information for pimavanserin. https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/files/files/JPAD%20CTAD%20abstracts.pdf; December 4, 2022 [Pooled Analysis] The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease - JPAD, Volume 9, Supplement 1, December 2022 Presented at the 15th Conference Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease, November 29-December 2, 2022, San Francisco, CA Online Published date: December 4, 2022 Abstract No.: P32 D.

Stankovic IMPACT OF PIMAVANSERIN TREATMENT ON MOTOR FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROPSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: RESULTS FROM 3 CLINICAL STUDIES. Results: Data from the integrated clinical development program in a subset of subjects with AD showed no evidence of a worsening of motor function, as measured by EPS events with 34 mg pimavanserin treatment compared with placebo in these 3 short-term studies. Incidence rates of EPS were similar for pimavanserin (3.4%; 10/292) and placebo (4.3%; 12/282). Moreover, the odds of an EPS event demonstrated no difference in the pimavanserin arm when compared to placebo with an odds ratio (OR, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]) of 0.80 (0.34, 1.88). TEAEs related to motor function included tremor (PBO=3 [1.1%], PIM=3 [1.0%]), mobility decreased (PBO=3 [1.1%], PIM=2 [0.7%]), restlessness (PBO=3 [1.1%], PIM=1 [0.3%]), dyskinesia (PBO=1 [0.4%], PIM=1 [0.3%]), gait disturbance (PBO=0, PIM=2 [0.7%]), muscle rigidity (PBO=0, PIM=2 [0.7%]), parkinsonism (PBO=1 [0.4%], PIM=1 [0.3%]), akathisia (PBO=0, PIM=1 [0.3%]) and musculoskeletal stiffness (PBO=1 [0.4%], PIM=0), none of which were different between pimavanserin and placebo. Conclusions: Decrease in motor function was minimal in pimavanserin-treated patients and similar to placebo across 3 randomized placebo-controlled studies in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In pimavanserin-treated patients, TEAEs related to motor dysfunction were reported infrequently and at similar rates to placebo.

Stankovic IMPACT OF PIMAVANSERIN ON COGNITIVE MEASURES IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROPSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: RESULTS FROM 3 PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. Results: Data from an integrated analysis of these studies showed no decline in cognitive function, as measured by MMSE score with pimavanserin treatment compared with placebo. Mean baseline (standard error [SE]) MMSE scores were similar for pimavanserin (14.7 [0.35]; n=292 and placebo (14.8 [0.37]; n=276). The pooled difference in MMRM least-squares (LS) mean (SE) was not significantly different for pimavanserin versus placebo (difference in LS means [SE]: 0.29 [0.325]; 95% CI of Difference [-0.34, 0.93]). Of the terms queried, only confusional state (reported in 6 [2.1%] pimavanserin and 2 [0.7%] placebo patients) was reported as a TEAE. Conclusions: Evidence from 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients with Alzheimer’s disease treated with pimavanserin show that mean changes in MMSE scores were small and similar to placebo. Cognition-related TEAEs were reported infrequently. These results demonstrate that treatment with pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on cognitive function with up to 12 weeks of treatment. https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/files/files/JPAD%20CTAD%20abstracts.pdf; April 13, 2021 [Pooled Analysis] Neurology Journal, Volume 96, Issue Supplement 15, April 2021 Presented at the 73rd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 17-22, 2021, Virtual Meeting Online published date: April 13, 2021 Abstract No.: 5/4531 Daniel Weintraub, Erin P.

During the double-blind period, mean CFB in total ESRS-A was small and similar in the 2 treatment groups at all time points. In the 046 interim analysis, least squares mean ESRS-A CFB to week 8 was similar for pimavanserin (-0.3 [0.37]; n=132) and placebo (-0.6 [0.37]; n=130). In each study, individual motor-related TEAEs in pimavanserin patients were reported at rates =2.2%; rates were similar to placebo. Conclusions: Mean changes in motor function were minimal in pimavanserin-treated patients and were similar to placebo. In pimavanserin-treated patients, motor-related TEAEs were reported infrequently and at similar rates to placebo.

Patients exposed to pimavanserin for the 9-month study duration (n=46) had a mean (SE) CFB of 1.2 (0.51). Confusional state and memory impairment were the only cognition-related TEAEs reported; they occurred infrequently and/or at rates similar to placebo. Conclusions: Across studies, mean MMSE score changes in pimavanserin-treated patients with NDD were small and were similar to placebo. Cognition-related TEAEs were reported infrequently. Overall, pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on cognitive function with up to 9 months of treatment.

Stankovic Impact Of Pimavanserin Treatment On Motor Function In Patients With Neurodegenerative Disease: Results From 3 Clinical Studies Results: In study 019, the mean (standard error [SE]) UPDRS III score at baseline was similar for the 74 patients on pimavanserin (12.5 [1.08]) and the 65 patients on placebo (11.8 [1.00]). Mean (SE) change from baseline to week 12 was similar for the pimavanserin (-1.0 [0.96]) and placebo (-0.5 [1.20]) groups. TEAEs related to motor function included dyskinesia, musculoskeletal stiffness (1 placebo [1.1%], 0 pimavanserin, each), tremor (0 placebo, 1 pimavanserin [1.1%]), gait disturbance (0 placebo, 2 pimavanserin [2.2%]), mobility decreased (3 placebo [3.3%], 2 pimavanserin [2.2%]), and restlessness (1 placebo [1.1%], 2 pimavanserin [2.2%]). In the HARMONY OL period, the mean ESRS-A score at baseline was 6.7 (0.60; N=392); the mean (SE) change from baseline to week 12 was minimal (-0.7 [0.17]; n=244) with a trend toward improved (rather than worsened) motor function. Motor TEAEs were infrequent; psychomotor hyperactivity was reported by 3 patients (0.8%), parkinsonism was reported by 2 patients (0.5%), and akathisia, dysphonia, mobility decreased and tremor were reported by 1 patient each (0.3%). During the DB period, there were no changes in mean ESRS-A score in pimavanserin-treated patients or difference over time for pimavanserin vs placebo. For TEAEs, musculoskeletal stiffness and restlessness were reported in 1 patient each (1.0%) in the pimavanserin group and were not reported in the placebo group; akathisia, dyskinesia, dystonia, and tremor were reported in 1 patient (1.0%) each in the placebo group and were not reported in the pimavanserin group. In the study 046 interim analysis, mean (SE) baseline ESRS-A scores were similar for patients randomized to pimavanserin (7.9 [1.01]; n=144) or placebo (6.7 [0.88]; n=144). Least-squares mean change from baseline to week 8 was similar for pimavanserin (-0.3 [0.37]; n=132) and placebo (-0.6 [0.37]; n=130). TEAEs related to motor function included propulsive gait (1 pimavanserin [0.7%], 0 placebo), muscle rigidity (1 pimavanserin [0.7%], 0 placebo), tremor (3 pimavanserin [2.1%], 1 placebo [0.7%]), akathisia (2 pimavanserin [1.4%], 0 placebo), and dyskinesia (1 pimavanserin [0.7%], 0 placebo). Conclusions: Mean changes in motor function were minimal in pimavanserin-treated patients and were similar to placebo across three randomized placebo-controlled studies in patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations of neurodegenerative disease. In pimavanserin-treated patients, TEAEs related to motor dysfunction were reported infrequently and at similar rates to placebo. Pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on motor function in this aggregated dataset of frail, vulnerable patients with a range of neurodegenerative diseases.

Stankovic Impact Of Pimavanserin On Cognitive Measures In Patients With Neurodegenerative Disease: Results From 4 Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies Results: In study 019, mean baseline (standard error [SE]) MMSE values were similar for pimavanserin (10.18 [0.581]; n=87) and placebo (9.85 [0.545]; n=85). The least-squares (LS) mean (SE) change from baseline to week 12 was not significantly different for pimavanserin (–0.25 [0.42]) versus placebo (0.10 [0.41]; difference in LS means [SE]: –0.35 [0.585]; 2-sided P=0.55). Of the terms queried, only confusional state (reported in 4 pimavanserin patients [4.4%] and 2 placebo patients [2.2%]) was reported as a TEAE. In the HARMONY OL period, the mean (SE) baseline MMSE score was 16.7 (0.24). Mean (SE) change from baseline was 1.0 (0.22) at week 12. Cognition-related TEAEs of confusional state (n=8; 2.0%) and mental impairment (n=2; 0.5%) were reported. Patients randomized to pimavanserin or placebo in the DB period had similar mean (SE) MMSE scores at DB baseline (18.3 [0.53] vs 17.9 [0.55]). During the DB period there was no decline observed in mean MMSE in pimavanserin-treated patients or difference from placebo-treated patients. Patients exposed to pimavanserin for the 9-month duration of the study (n=46) had a mean (SE) change from OL baseline of 1.2 (0.51), indicating no evidence of cognitive decline. In the DB period, only confusional state was reported in 1 pimavanserin patient (1.0%) and no placebo patients. Post hoc analyses did not reveal specific subpopulations at increased risk of large MMSE score changes. In the Study 046 interim analysis, baseline mean (SE) MMSE scores were 18.5 (0.42) in the pimavanserin group and 19.2 (0.39) in the placebo group. The LS mean (SE) change from baseline to week 8 was 1.2 (0.21) in the pimavanserin group and 0.5 (0.21) in the placebo group. The TEAE of confusional state was reported in one pimavanserin patient (0.7%). In study 032, 36 patients were randomized to pimavanserin 34 mg, and 40 were randomized to placebo. The LS mean (SE) change from baseline to week 12 was small and was similar for pimavanserin (0.0 [0.57]) and placebo (0.0 [0.55]). The TEAE of confusional state was reported in two pimavanserin patients (2.8%); no cognition-related TEAEs were reported in the placebo group. Conclusions: Evidence from 4 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients with neurodegenerative disease treated with pimavanserin show that mean changes in MMSE scores were small and were similar to placebo. Cognitionrelated TEAEs were reported infrequently. These results demonstrate that treatment with pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on cognitive function with up to 9 months of treatment.

Daniel Weintraub, Alberto J Espay, Vibhash D Sharma, Pierre N Tariot, Victor Abler, Sanjeev Pathak, Srdjan Stankovic Pimavanserin for psychosis in Parkinson's disease dementia: Subgroup analysis of the HARMONY Trial Results: 392 patients were enrolled in HARMONY (mean age: 72.6 years; 38.8 % female): 59 had PDD; 49/59 remained on pimavanserin during the open-label period (safety analysis set), and 36/49 were randomized to pimavanserin (n = 16) or placebo (n = 20) in the double-blind phase (intent-to-treat analysis set). Risk of psychosis relapse was lower with pimavanserin 34 mg compared with placebo in the double-blind phase (HR = 0.052; 95 % CI 0.016-0.166; 1-sided nominal p < 0.001). During the open-label period, 46.9 % experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event; event incidence was similar across arms in the double-blind period. Pimavanserin did not adversely affect motor or cognitive function in either treatment phase. Conclusions: Pimavanserin significantly reduced risk of psychosis relapse in patients with PDD, was well tolerated, and did not worsen motor or cognitive function.

Abler, C. Ballard, A. Berrio, B. Coate, C. Brain, A. Espay; Motor-Related and Cognition-Related Safety of Pimavanserin in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis (PDP) Results: Baseline MMSE score ranged from 18–30 (PDP pooled) and 8–27 (HARMONY PDD). In the pooled analysis, least squares mean (LSM) (standard error [SE]) change from baseline (CFB) to week 6 for UPDRS II + III score was similar for pimavanserin (-2.4 [0.69]) and placebo (-2.3 [0.60]). CFB to week 6 for UPDRS II and UPDRS III scores were similar between groups. In HARMONY, OL mean (SE) CFB to week 12 (n = 39) ESRS-A score was -1.7 (0.74). DB mean (SE) CFB to week 26 ESRS-A score was similar between pimavanserin (n = 4, 1.0 [2.68]) and placebo (n = 2, 0.5 [1.50]). MMSE score mean (SE) CFB was 0.3 (0.66) at OL week 12 (n = 37) and was comparable between pimavanserin- and placebo-treated patients at DB week 26 (pimavanserin [n = 4], 0.8 [0.75]; placebo [n = 2], 0.5 [2.50]). Rates of motor-related and cognition-related adverse events were balanced between pimavanserin and placebo in both analyses.

Tariot, Suzanne B. Hendrix, Samuel P. Dickson, Caiyan Li, Victor Abler, Sanjeev Pathak, Srdjan Stankovic; Efficacy And Safety Of Pimavanserin In Patients With Alzheimer’S Dementia Psychosis In The Harmony Phase 3, Randomized Discontinuation Study: A Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis Result: Of 260 ADP patients, 243 stayed on pimavanserin 34mg throughout the OL period; 17 patients received pimavanserin 20mg beyond OL week 4. At baseline, mean age in the pimavanserin 34mg group was 75.7 years; mean MMSE score was 16.0. Twenty-nine patients were terminated with sponsor termination of the study; of the remaining 214 patients, 130 (60.7%) met response criteria at weeks 8 and 12 and were randomized. At the IA, 116 ADP patients were randomized to pimavanserin 34mg (N = 57) or placebo (N = 59). Hazard ratio for psychosis relapse risk with pimavanserin 34mg versus placebo was 0.466 (95% CI: 0.179, 1.214); 6/57 (10.5%) pimavanserin-treated and 14/59 (23.7%) placebo-treated patients met relapse criteria. Treatment-emergent adverse events incidence rates were: OL, 29.6% (72/243); DB-pimavanserin 34mg, 39.7% (25/63); DB-placebo, 34.3% (23/67). Pimavanserin did not have a negative effect on Mini-Mental State Examination or Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale-Abbreviated score change from baseline versus placebo in the DB period. Conclusion: In a study that met its primary endpoint, a post-hoc subgroup analysis in ADP, although not statistically significant, demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of relapse was observed in patients treated with pimavanserin 34mg versus placebo. Pimavanserin was not associated with an adverse impact on cognition or motor function. https://alz.confex.com/alz/2022/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/62364; April 2, 2022 [Post-hoc analysis] Presented at the 74th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 2-7, 2022, Seattle, WA and April 24-26, 2022, Virtual Meeting Available online date: April 2, 2022 Daniel Weintraub, Alberto Espay, Vibhash Sharma, Pierre Tariot, Victor Abler, Sanjeev Pathak, Srdjan Stankovic Pimavanserin Treatment Of Hallucinations And Delusions In Patients With Parkinson’S Disease Dementia: Post Hoc Analysis Of The Harmony Trial Results: 59 enrollees had PDD and initiated pimavanserin 34 mg, 49/59 continued to receive pimavanserin 34 mg. In the OL period, most PDD patients (73.5% [36/49]) exhibited a sustained response and were randomized to pimavanserin (n = 16) or placebo (n = 20). The risk of psychosis relapse was lower with pimavanserin than placebo (hazard ratio: 0.052; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.166; 1-sided P < 0.0001). 1 pimavanserin-treated and 9 placebo-treated patients met relapse criteria. In the OL period, 46.9% (n = 23) of patients experienced any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). During the DB period, TEAE rates were balanced (pimavanserin, 31.3% [n = 5], placebo, 45.0% [n = 9]). There was no negative effect of pimavanserin on ESRS-A or MMSE scores over the duration of the study. Conclusions: Pimavanserin 34 mg reduced the risk of psychosis relapse in PDD patients. Pimavanserin was well tolerated, with no negative effect on motor or cognitive function. These data show the maintenance of antipsychotic efficacy and safety of pimavanserin in PDD patients. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2022/PDFfiles/AAN2022-001162.html; December 2, 2021 [Pooled analysis] Neuropsychopharmacology volume 46, pages 1– 518 (2021), December 2021 Presented at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, December 5-8, 2021, San Juan, Puerto Rico Published online date: December 2, 2021 Abstract No. P518 Mona Darwish, Dragana Bugarski-Kirola, David Jaworowicz, Joel Owen, Alida Barry, Daryl DeKarske, Srdjan Stankovic Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Stochastic Simulations to Support Pediatric Dose Selection of Pimavanserin Results: Graphical and tabular comparisons of simulated pimavanserin drug exposures illustrated that steady-state AUC levels following 34-mg dosing were generally not different across the range of age groups or body weight groups. There was a trend for higher Cmax with decreasing age and body weight in pediatric groups. In the adult population (18–49 years), mean AUC ranged from 47.41 to 54.73 ng x d/mL and mean Cmax ranged from 41.13 to 50.07 ng/mL. In the young pediatric population (5–9 years), simulations predicted that a 20-mg dose would produce a distribution of Cmax (mean [SD]: 45.30 [21.31] ng/mL) that would be similar to Cmax associated with the 34-mg dose in the adult population. In the older pediatric population (aged 10–17 years), a 34-mg dose was predicted to yield a Cmax distribution (mean [SD], 56.54 [24.58] ng/ML) similar to steady state exposures associated with a 34-mg dose in the adult population. Conclusions: Model-based stochastic simulations exploring 4 dose levels of pimavanserin indicate that pimavanserin 20 mg may be most appropriate in a young pediatric population (5–9 years) and pimavanserin 34 mg may be most appropriate in an older pediatric population (10–17 years) to yield steady-state pimavanserin exposures similar to a daily pimavanserin 34-mg oral dose in adults (18–49 years). These results could inform dose selection in pediatric patients.

Results: 392 patients were enrolled into the OL period of HARMONY. Of the 59 with PD psychosis and PD dementia, 49 received pimavanserin 34 mg and were analyzed here. The mean (standard error [SE]) age was 72.6 (1.08) and 61.2% (n = 30) were male. At OL baseline, 32.7% (n = 16) of patients exhibited mild dementia, 57.1% (n = 28) exhibited moderate dementia, and 10.2% (n = 5) exhibited severe dementia. The mean (SE) duration of cognitive impairment at baseline was 3.8 (0.33) years, and mean (SE) MMSE score at baseline was 18.9 (0.74). Patients had a mean SAPS-H+D total score of 23.5 (SE, 1.45) and 36.7% (n = 18) had previously received medication to treat psychosis. Most patients (73.5% [36 of 49]) exhibited a sustained response to pimavanserin at weeks 8 and 12 during the OL period and were randomized to pimavanserin (n = 16) or placebo (n = 20) in the DB period. Of 38 patients evaluated at week 12, 42.1% (n = 16) exhibited a complete response to pimavanserin (SAPSH+D score = 0) at week 12. The risk of psychosis relapse was lower in the pimavanserin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.052; 95% CI: 0.016, 0.166; 1-sided P <0.0001).At the time the study was stopped, 1 pimavanserin-treated patient and 9 placebo-treated patients had met relapse criteria. In the OL period, 46.9% (n = 23) of PD participants experienced any TEAE and 10.2% (n = 5) experienced a serious TEAE. The most common TEAEs during the OL period were insomnia (8.2%), somnolence (8.2%), decreased appetite (8.2%), weight decreased (8.2%), fall (6.1%), and urinary tract infection (6.1%). During the DB period, 31.3% (n = 5) of pimavanserin-treated and 45.0% (n = 9) of placebo-treated patients experienced any TEAE. No patients experienced any serious TEAEs in the DB period. The mean ESRS-A score at OL baseline was 26.2 (SE, 1.89), and the mean change from baseline to week 12 was -1.7 (SE, 0.74). Mean ESRS-A scores at DB baseline (pimavanserin, 27.4 [SE, 3.99]; placebo, 26.3 [SE, 3.14]) and mean change from DB baseline to week 26 were similar in pimavanserin- and placebo-treated patients. The mean MMSE score at OL baseline was 18.9 (SE, 0.74), and the mean change from baseline to week 12 was 0.3 (SE, 0.66). Patients randomized to pimavanserin and placebo had similar mean MMSE scores at DB baseline (pimavanserin, 19.6 [SE, 1.26]; placebo, 19.3 [SE, 1.29]) and exhibited a similar mean MMSE score change from DB baseline to week 26. Conclusions: Pimavanserin reduced the risk of psychosis relapse in PD psychosis patients with PD dementia. Pimavanserin was well tolerated and did not have a negative effect on motor or cognitive function. These data support the demonstrated efficacy and safety of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions in patients with PD psychosis to those with PD psychosis and PD dementia [Page No.: 7/100 at PDF URL] https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/files/files/CTAD21%20Posters.pdf; July 26, 2021 [Additional Analysis] Presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), July 26-30, 2021, Denver, CO and Virtual meeting Online published date: July 26, 2021 Erin P. Foff, Bradley McEvoy, Benjamin Skoog, George Demos Pimavanserin and Concomitant Antidementia Medication Use In Patients With Neurodegenerative And/Or Neurovascular Disorders: Safety Outcomes From Pooled Clinical Data And The HARMONY Study. Results: In the pooled NDD population, 291 (50.2%) pimavanserin-treated and 305 (47.0%) placebo-treated patients had cADM use. Those with cADM use had lower rates of TEAEs (pimavanserin: 51.2%, placebo: 52.1%) vs those without (pimavanserin: 56.7%, placebo: 59.6%). Rates of serious TEAEs were also similar in patients treated with cADM (pimavanserin: 6.9%, placebo: 4.6%) vs those without cADM (pimavanserin: 7.3%, placebo: 4.1%). In the OL period of HARMONY, 273 (69.6%) patients had cADM use; their rates of TEAEs (with cADM: 32.2%, without cADM: 45.4%) and serious TEAEs (with cADM: 3.3%; without cADM: 9.2%) were similar to patients without. In the DB period, 81 (77.1%) pimavanserin-treated and 72 (64.3%) placebo-treated patients used cADM. DB patients with cADM use exhibited rates of TEAEs (pimavanserin: 37.0%, placebo: 31.9%) and serious TEAEs (pimavanserin: 3.7%, placebo: 4.2%) similar to patients without (TEAEs, pimavanserin: 54.2%, placebo: 45.0%; serious TEAEs, pimavanserin: 8.3%, placebo: 2.5%). Conclusions: Patients with NDD receiving pimavanserin in clinical trials commonly took cADMs. There was no evidence that concomitant pimavanserin use resulted in a differential TEAE or serious TEAE profile in patients taking antidementia medications. https://alz.confex.com/alz/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/57661; July 26, 2021 [Additional Analysis] Presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), July 26-30, 2021, Denver, CO and Virtual meeting Online published date: July 26, 2021 Mona Darwish, David Jaworowicz, Joel Owen, Teresa Brandt, Daryl DeKarske, Srdjan Stankovic Impact of Concomitant Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Use on the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Pimavanserin in Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Modeling Data From the Phase 3 HORMANY Study. Results: 158/337 (46.9%) patients in HARMONY had concomitant AChEI use (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine). In patients with/without AChEI use, CL/F and V/F showed no apparent differences between groups. Covariate testing found no statistically significant effect (a = 0.05) of AChEI use on CL/F or V/F. Minimal differences in predicted steady-state pimavanserin exposures were observed between patients with concomitant AChEI use and those without (Table 1); median Cmax was 8.4% higher (with AChEI: 57.9 ng/mL; without AChEI: 53.4 ng/mL) and median AUC was 9.2% higher (with AChEI: 1328.9 ng × h/mL; without AChEI: 1216.5 ng × h/mL). Conclusions: Concomitant AChEIs had no significant effect on the PK parameters of pimavanserin. Differences in exposure measures (Cmax and AUC) between groups were negligible (<10%).

(Nasdaq: ACAD) announced today that the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the Phase 3 HARMONY study, an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse prevention trial in 392 patients evaluating pimavanserin as an investigational treatment in patients with hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis (DRP). The study included patients across five subgroups of dementia: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease dementia, and vascular dementia. The HARMONY study was stopped early due to positive efficacy at the pre-planned interim analysis upon recommendation of the trial’s independent data safety monitoring board. HARMONY met its primary endpoint by significantly reducing the risk of relapse of psychosis by 2.8 fold compared to placebo in the double-blind period (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.35, two-sided p = 0.005; one-sided p = 0.0023). The study also met its secondary endpoint by significantly reducing the time to trial discontinuation for any reason (HR = 0.45, two-sided p=0.005; one-sided p = 0.0024). The data from the HARMONY study demonstrates that patients with DRP who had responded to pimavanserin had a significantly lower risk of relapse of psychosis with continuation of pimavanserin compared to placebo up to 26 weeks. “The relapse prevention design of the HARMONY study mirrors exactly what we do in clinical practice. This landmark trial showed that when patients responded to pimavanserin and then continued treatment, they were almost three times less likely to develop recurrence of their hallucinations and delusions than those patients who discontinued pimavanserin treatment,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Pierre N. Tariot, Banner Alzheimer’s Institute director. “This is a substantial finding and a significant advance for a critical public health need in our field. There is no FDA approved treatment for DRP, and the majority of antipsychotics currently used off-label have equivocal efficacy and may accelerate cognitive decline.” Pimavanserin was well-tolerated over the nine-month study duration. In a pre-specified analysis, pimavanserin was not associated with a decline in cognition as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the onset or worsening of motor symptoms as measured by Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale A (ESRS-A). “The HARMONY study findings demonstrated three important results. First, in the 12-week open-label period, pimavanserin treatment showed a sustained reduction of psychotic symptoms. Second, in the 26-week double-blind period, patients on pimavanserin had a nearly three-fold reduction of risk of psychosis relapse compared to patients on placebo. Third, pimavanserin was well-tolerated by elderly patients with DRP,” said Steve Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Acadia. “We are very pleased that the New England Journal of Medicine has chosen to publish the important results of this study.” About HARMONY HARMONY was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis. The study included patients with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease dementia, and vascular dementia. A total of 392 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 74.5 years and a mean MMSE score of 16.7. The primary endpoint in the study was time from randomization to relapse of psychosis in the double-blind period as represented by the Kaplan-Meier curve and the hazard ratio. The HARMONY study included a 12-week, open-label stabilization period during which patients with dementia-related psychosis began treatment with pimavanserin 34 mg once daily. In the open-label period, a majority (61.8%) of eligible subjects (n=351) met the sustained treatment response criteria at Week 8 and Week 12 and entered the double-blind period. Following the open-label period, patients who met pre-specified criteria for sustained treatment response were then randomized into the double-blind period of the study to continue their pimavanserin dose or switched to placebo and followed for up to 26 weeks or until a relapse of psychosis occurred. Pimavanserin met its primary endpoint and was stopped at the pre-planned interim analysis for positive efficacy, demonstrating that pimavanserin significantly reduced the risk of relapse of psychosis by 2.8 fold compared to placebo (HR = 0.35, p = 0.005). In the double-blind period, similar, low rates of adverse events were observed, 43 (41.0%) patients on pimavanserin (n=105) and 41 (36.6%) patients on placebo (n=112). Discontinuations in the double-blind period due to adverse events were low, 2.9% for pimavanserin and 3.6% for placebo. Rates of serious adverse events were also low, 4.8% in the pimavanserin group and 3.6% in the placebo group. One death was reported in the open-label period and one death was reported in the pimavanserin group during the double-blind period. Investigators determined that neither death was related to the study drug... https://ir.acadia-pharm.com//news-releases/news-release-details/new-england-journal-medicine-publishes-results-phase-3-harmony; June 21, 2021 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: June 21, 2021 Last Update Posted: June 21, 2021 Recruitment Details: The study was performed in subjects with all-cause dementia according to NIA-AA guidelines, including dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, possible or probable Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal degeneration spectrum disorder, and/or vascular dementia, and were to have had at least a 2-month history of psychotic symptoms.

Foff, Clive Ballard, Bradley McEvoy, Bruce Coate, George Demos, Ana Berrio, Brandon Abbs, James M. Youakim, Srdjan Stankovic Motor Function in Patients with Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Neurodegenerative Disease Treated with Pimavanserin. Results: In 019, mean (SE) UPDRS change from baseline (CFB) to week 12 was similar for pimavanserin (-1.0 [0.96]; n=41) and placebo (-0.5 [1.20]; n=44). In the HARMONY open-label period, the mean (SE) ESRS-A CFB to week 12 was minimal (-0.7 [0.17]; n=244), with a trend toward improved motor function. During the double-blind period, mean CFB in total ESRS-A was small and similar in the 2 treatment groups at all time points. In the 046 interim analysis, least squares mean ESRS-A CFB to week 8 was similar for pimavanserin (-0.3 [0.37]; n=132) and placebo (-0.6 [0.37]; n=130). In each study, individual motor-related TEAEs in pimavanserin patients were reported at rates =2.2%; rates were similar to placebo. Conclusions: Mean changes in motor function were minimal in pimavanserin-treated patients and were similar to placebo. In pimavanserin-treated patients, motor-related TEAEs were reported infrequently and at similar rates to placebo. Pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on motor function in this aggregated dataset of frail, vulnerable patients.

Results: In 019 and 032, the MMSE score least squares (LS) mean (SE) change from baseline (CFB) to week 12 was -0.25 (0.42) and 0.0 (0.57), respectively, and similar to placebo. In the 046 interim analysis, the LS mean (SE) CFB to week 8 was 1.2 (0.21; n=132) for pimavanserin and 0.5 (0.21; n=128) for placebo. In HARMONY, mean (SE) CFB to week 12 was 1.0 (0.22; n=245). During the HARMONY double-blind period, mean MMSE score with pimavanserin did not decline and was similar to placebo. Patients exposed to pimavanserin for the 9-month study duration (n=46) had a mean (SE) CFB of 1.2 (0.51). Confusional state and memory impairment were the only cognition-related TEAEs reported; they occurred infrequently and/or at rates similar to placebo. Conclusions: Across studies, mean MMSE score changes in pimavanserin-treated patients with NDD were small and were similar to placebo. Cognition-related TEAEs were reported infrequently. Overall, pimavanserin did not have a negative impact on cognitive function with up to 9 months of treatment.

At the interim analysis point, 46 patients had completed the 18 month treatment period. In light of the interim analysis, it was considered extremely unlikely that the study would demonstrate signifi cant therapeutic benefi t of pioglitazone after the 18 month treatment period in the remaining trial participants. Discussion: The study revealed that the application of pioglitazone to ALS-patients is safe. However, the results of this phase II study strongly suggest that pioglitazone is ineffective in slowing down the course of clinical ALS. We are presently performing detailed analyses of the data, including biological markers. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=2131 (Page: 2 of 2)","Secondary Outcome Measures Incidence of tracheotomy or non-invasive ventilation [ Time Frame: 18 month ].

This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). Total scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 48 (normal ability). ALSFRS-R was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in ability over time. Mean Rate of Change of Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6) ] Vital capacity (VC), percent of predicted normal, was determined using the slow VC method. SVC measures the amount of air exhaled following a deep breath. For this test, participants hold a mouthpiece in their mouth, breathe in deeply, and breathe out as much air as they can. The test was done seated in a chair and then repeated while lying on an exam table at the Screening Visit. For all other visits, this test was done while seated in a chair. This test takes 15-20 minutes. SVC was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. SVC is a way to measure respiratory insufficiency in persons with ALS and SVC decreases as ALS progresses. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline over time. Mean Rate of Change of Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6) ] Hand held dynamometry (HHD) is a measure of muscle strength and scores decrease as ALS progresses. Six proximal muscle groups were examined bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. Mean and standard deviation for each muscle group are established from the initial values for each participant. Strength determinations were converted to Z scores and averaged to provide an HHD megascore. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of 0. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. HHD was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in strength over time. Mean Rate of Change in Grip Strength Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6) ] Hand grip was measured using a study approved dynamometer to test the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The grip strength of the left and right hands were analyzed together. Grip strength was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. Grip strength is a measurement of muscle strength and declines as ALS progresses. A positive value means that scores during treatment were higher than pre-treatment scores, indicating an increase in grip strength over time. Mean Rate of Change of T-cell Subsets in Blood Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (2 months prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and Months 1, 2, 4, 6) ] Blood was collected for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the mean rate of decline of T-cells during the 6 month treatment period compared to the pre-treatment period was assessed (blood was collected twice during the 3-month long lead in period). The precise role that T-cells have in ALS is unknown and this study aims to further the understanding of how T-cells operate in persons with ALS. T-cell measurement is a ratio where the relative expression levels of FOXP3 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was calculated using the Comparative CT Method (??CT Method), normalizing to ß-actin. Samples were obtained during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in T-cells over time. Collection of Cerebrospinal Fluid for Future Analysis of Cytokine Levels [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (two months prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Months 2 and 6), Post-Treatment Period (Month 12) ] Lumbar punctures (LPs) were performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is banked for future use to characterize immune system markers and to further the understanding of the immune factors that contribute to disease progression in ALS. Cytokines are markers of neuroinflammation and can be categorized as neurotoxic or neuroprotective. The role that cytokines play in in ALS progression is still not yet fully understood. Collection of Blood for Future Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) [ Time Frame: Pre-Treatment Period (2 months prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and Months 1, 2, 4, 6), Post-Treatment Period (Months 8 and 12) ] Blood was drawn and banked for future use in order to characterize immune system markers and further the understanding of the immune factors that contribute to disease progression in ALS.",2013P000981 NCT01884571 NIP-ALS-2013 NIPALS2013 TrialTroveID-188964,"Primary objective: To assess the clinical response rate of a novel immunosuppression regimen in a subset of ALS patients.

ALSFRS-R Mortality,1,"March 7, 2024 [Interim Results] AAN 2024 Available online date: March 7, 2024 Abstract No. S5.003 Shefner, Jeremy Oskarsson, Bjorn Cohen, Yael Chen, Kelly Leitner, Melanie Berry, James Macklin, Eric Chibnik, Lori Pothier, Lindsay Geva, Michal Goldberg, Paul Hayden, Michael Paganoni, Sabrina Cudkowicz, Merit Pridopidine for the Treatment of ALS—Results from the Phase 2 Healey ALS Platform Trial Results Pridopidine was well tolerated, consistent with prior safety profile. Primary endpoint was not met in the FAS. Significant speech improvements were observed in the FAS, and post-hoc analysis of definite+probable ALS, early and fast progressors (pridopidine n=20; placebo n=14), showed a greater improvement in speaking rate (?1.08, p<0.0001 and articulation rate (?1.03, p<0.0001). In definite ALS and early participants, pridopidine trended favorably in ALSFRS-R progression (?2.4, p=0.19) and respiratory domain (?1.04, p=0.18), and improved in dyspnea (?1.35, p=0.014). Definite+probable ALS, early and fast progressors showed a greater improvement in ALSFRS-R (?5.2, p=0.04). Less decline on the ALSAQ-40 quality of life scale (? -10.83, p=0.018), in eating & drinking (?-19.18, p=0.015) and a trend in communication (?-13.04, p=0.12) were seen in definite ALS and early participants. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a prolongation of median survival time, from ~300 to 600 days in definite+probable ALS and early participants (n=37) compared to the delayed-start (168 days) placebo participants (n=12) (log rank test: p=0.069). Conclusion Beneficial effects of pridopidine were observed in speech (FAS) and multiple measures of disease progression (post-hoc subgroups). This includes an increase in survival time for definite+probable ALS & early participants. These observations inform the ongoing planning for a Phase 3 study. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2024/PDFfiles/AAN2024-006524.html; August 23, 2023 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: August 23, 2023 Last Update Posted: August 23, 2023 Recruitment Details: Pre-assignment Details: Limitations and Caveats: [Not Specified] [Refer to source URL for tabular data] https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04615923; February 23, 2023 [Press release] Prilenia Announces Topline Results for Pridopidine in Phase 2 ALS Study - The primary and key secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance - Beneficial effects were observed across several secondary and exploratory endpoints - Both pre-specified and post-hoc analyses in early, fast progressors showed benefit in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and neurofilament light (NfL) - These results provide valuable insights, which will inform future clinical development for pridopidine in ALS Naarden, NL and WALTHAM, Mass, 23 February 2023 – Prilenia Therapeutics B.V., a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the urgent mission to develop novel therapeutics to slow the progression of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, today announced initial results from the pridopidine arm of the Phase 2 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial. Pridopidine is an oral, small molecule, highly selective and potent Sigma-1 Receptor (S1R) agonist. It is an investigational drug, and its safety and efficacy have not been determined by the FDA. While pridopidine did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 24 in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), there were consistent, positive trends observed among participants receiving pridopidine across several pre-specified secondary and exploratory measures. In post-hoc analyses, rapidly declining participants on pridopidine with definite or probable ALS who were early in the disease (less than 18 months from symptom onset) had substantially less decline in the ALSFRS-R total score (-7.51 points) compared to placebo (-12.71 points, unadjusted p-value=0.04). Trends for less decline in the ALSFRS-R respiratory sub-scale were also seen in all participants (p=0.06). In pre-specified analyses of all study participants, benefits were observed in quantitative speech measures with significant improvement in speaking rate (p=0.028) and articulation rate (p=0.013). Neurofilament light (NfL) is a well-recognized biomarker of ongoing neuronal injury that is increased in neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Huntington’s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Pridopidine reduced NfL levels in rapidly declining patients with disease duration less than 18 months (average reduction of 40%) at 24 weeks compared to placebo in post-hoc analyses. Data from this and other clinical studies show that pridopidine was well-tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo. There were no new safety indicators as compared to previous clinical studies where pridopidine was similarly safe and well-tolerated... Prilenia is exploring potential next steps for pridopidine in ALS. Additional analyses are underway, including from the open-label extension study, and complete study results will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings... https://www.prilenia.com/prilenia-announces-topline-results-for-pridopidine-in-phase2-als-study","Secondary Outcome Measures : Change in Bulbar Function in Participants With Bulbar Dysfunction at Baseline [ Time Frame: Baseline to 24 Weeks ] Change in bulbar function over time in participants with bulbar dysfunction at baseline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) bulbar subdomain.

Long-Term Plasma NfL Biomarker Findings from Regimen C (CNM-Au8) in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Open Label Extension (OLE) Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a blood-based biomarker associated with neurodegeneration, declined by 16% (95% CI: 2% to 28%) from baseline to 76 weeks of treatment in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Open Label Extension (OLE) in participants randomized to CNM-Au8 30 mg relative to participants initially randomized to placebo (p=0.023). CNM-Au8 was associated with a 10% relative reduction in plasma NfL over the 24-week double-blind treatment period of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial (p=0.040). This effect on NfL appears durable over the long-term follow-up period. NfL, a key biomarker of neurodegeneration, is released from neurons following axonal injury, especially in people living with ALS, where higher levels of NfL have been found to predict more rapid decline in clinical function and increased mortality risk. Biomarkers such as NfL that are considered reasonably likely to serve as surrogates of effects on clinical endpoints have recently been used to support an FDA approval of a drug for the treatment of ALS. The post hoc NfL results are based on analyses of plasma NfL collected from participants in the HEALEY OLE who were treated with CNM-Au8 for up to 76 weeks compared to participants treated with placebo for 24 weeks prior to crossing over to active treatment. CNM-Au8 30mg treatment reduced plasma NfL levels compared to baseline: Mixed Model with Repeat Measures (MMRM), Least Squared Means on a Natural Log (Ln) Scale for the 76-week change from baseline of plasma NfL: CNM-Au8 = -0.075 (SE: 0.053); placebo = +0.098 (SE: 0.056); CNM-Au8 30mg vs. original placebo difference of LS Means on a Ln Scale = -0.173 (SE: 0.076), p=0.023. Combined analyses of both CNM-Au8 doses (30mg and 60mg) also demonstrated nominally significant reductions in plasma NfL, CNM-Au8 vs. placebo difference of LS Means on a Ln Scale = -0.144 (SE: 0.066), p=0.029. Participants were treated with CNM-Au8 in the OLE for as long as 2.6 years from original randomization, providing long-term data on treatment effects in people living with ALS... ... Long-Term Survival Improvement from Regimen C (CNM-Au8) in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Open Label Extension (OLE) Long-term survival analyses included the prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) to account for the effects of CNM-Au8 in participants randomized to placebo who crossed-over to treatment with CNM-Au8. Under an assumption of a constant common treatment effect from CNM-Au8, treatment with CNM-Au8 demonstrated a 60% decreased risk of long-term all-cause mortality in participants originally randomized to treatment with CNM-Au8 compared to those originally randomized to placebo, after adjusting for the estimated benefit received after switching to CNM-Au8 (Cox HR= 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.85; p-value= 0.017). The RPSFTM analysis estimates the survival gained by receiving active treatment using the data from all study participants and then subtracting the estimated benefit from ex-placebo participants switched to CNM-Au8 during the OLE to provide a comparison of CNM-Au8 versus placebo across the entire study period. Merit Cudkowicz, M.D., Chair Neurology Department, Director, Sean M Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Mass General Hospital, Julianne Dorn Professor of Neurology Harvard Medical School, and the Principal Investigator of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, said, “These long-term results provide additional promising evidence that CNM-Au8 may offer more time to people living with ALS. The survival analyses using RPSFTM is a well-recognized method that has been used to estimate cross-over effects in another recent ALS trial, as well as oncology and other rare diseases. Additional analyses of the open label data are underway.”... https://invest.clene.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clene-reports-reduction-biomarker-plasma-neurofilament-light-nfl; September 25, 2023 [Press Release] [Post-hoc-Analysis] CLENE REPORTS SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL IMPROVEMENT FROM CNM-AU8 TREATMENT IN HEALEY ALS PLATFORM TRIAL COMPARED TO PRO-ACT HISTORICAL CONTROLS - Prolonged life with 49% decreased risk of death for participants in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial treated with CNM-Au8® 30mg compared to PRO-ACT matched placebo over long-term follow-up, p=0.046 - Prolonged life with 59% decreased risk of death for participants in an integrated meta-analysis across HEALEY ALS Platform Trial and RESCUE-ALS Trial with CNM-Au8 30mg compared to PRO-ACT matched placebo over long-term follow-up, p=0.004 - More than 500 patient years of CNM-Au8 treatment exposure without any identified safety signals SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clene Inc.

Drake , M. Cudkowicz Successful launch of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial during the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol amendments and operational changes to make the trial “COVIDresilient” and ensure robust enrollment and high data quality Results: Because the Platform Trial is conducted under centralized infrastructure, protocol changes recommended by the COVID-19 Task Force were implemented rapidly. Pulmonary function was collected using coached home spirometry on a portable device. Telemedicine was added for follow-up study visits and collection of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). Vital signs and safety labs were outsourced to a home nursing vendor or local laboratory. The electronic data capture system was modified to capture COVID-related deviations as required by the FDA. Site monitoring has been completed using remote monitoring visits. With these modifications, the trial enrolled the first participant in July 2020 and has met the target rate of approximately 1 participant enrolled/site/month. Data completeness has been high. Discussion: The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial has demonstrated robust enrollment rates and high data quality despite widespread restrictions caused by the pandemic. These results were achieved through a focused set of protocol changes, as well as close communication with industry partners, trial sites, and the patient community. Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic can be leveraged to increase access, operational feasibility, and quality of ALS clinical trials long term.

Adverse effects of variable severity were encountered in all patients. Two patients (N65S and D90A) were unable to complete the study because of adverse effects. In non-A4V patients, SOD1 levels showed medication dependent reduction in SOD1 levels between 3060 percent. Pyrimethamine administration had no effect on SOD1 levels in the 2 patients with the A4V mutation. In the 18 week period, AALS, ALSFRS, and MQOL scores showed no significant change in non-A4V patients. There was, however, significant deterioration in patients with A4V mutations during the study period. Discussion and Conclusions: Pyrimethamine is capable of reducing levels of SOD1 in mouse lymphocytes, mouse spinal cord and persistently in human lymphocytes to up to 60% of normal. However, patients with the A4V mutation seem resistant the effects of pyrimethamine. While the safety and tolerability of PYR in FALS patients remains unsettled, we believe determination of an optimal dose will decrease adverse events. Larger trials to determine clinical efficacy and possible mutation specific effects are needed. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1271 (Page: 2 of 3); April 16, 2008 Presented at the 60th AAN Annual Meeting, April 12-19, 2008, Chicago, IL Poster No: P04.088 Pyrimethamine Reduces SOD1 Levels in Familial ALS: Assessment of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Results: We enrolled two patients with weakness and an SOD1 mutation. Both patients reported adverse effects including malaise, headache, nausea, and tinnitus, making it necessary to alter the rate of dose escalation. Patient 1 completed the study taking 100mg/d; SOD1 levels were persistently lowered by 40-50%. At plateau, plasma pyrimethamine levels were: 4.2740.057 uM; CSF levels: 0.8300.056 uM. AALS score improved from 61 to 44. Patient 2 withdrew at week 14 from adverse effects. At a dose of 50 mg/d, lymphocyte SOD1 levels were decreased by 50%. AALS was unchanged but grip subscore improved. Neither patient showed changes in ALSFRS or MQOL. Conclusions/Relevance: Pyrimethamine lowers blood lymphocyte SOD1 levels in FALS patients. Adverse effects may interfere with chronic use. Further studies are needed to determine optimum dose and clinical efficacy. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2008chicago/view.php?nu=AAN08L_P04.088",,TrialTroveID-087390,,,,87390,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,Ii,,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Results: In the dose-escalation study, all subjects increased daily R+PPX intake safely to 100 mg t.i.d. Markers of ALS did not change (ALSFRS-R) or improved (FVC). Trough and peak plasma (PPX) increased linearly with dosing, and several subjects achieved plasma (PPX) >1 microM. In the open-label extension protocol, changing from 30 to 60 mg/day caused a non-significant 17% reduction in slope of decline of ALSFRS-R. Conclusions: It was concluded that R+PPX was tolerated well in long-term dosing at 30 and 60 mg/day. Encouraging but non-significant effects of R+PPX on ALS decline were observed. High doses of R+PPX were tolerated well and yielded neuroprotective plasma levels.

Sherman Increased Lean Mass and Muscle Volume in Healthy Post-Menopausal Women Treated with ACE-031 (Soluble Activin Type IIB Receptor), an Inhibitor of Myostatin and Other Negative Regulators of Muscle Preliminary Results: ACE-031 was generally well-tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events were injection site erythema, headache, and epistaxis. ACE-031 demonstrated a PK profile that supports SC dosing every 2-4 weeks. PD effects included the following (mean maximum percent change from baseline across dose groups indicated): Total body lean mass (DXA) increased up to 5.2% and thigh muscle volume (MRI) increased up to 4.1% at doses of 1 mg/kg q2 weeks or 2 mg/kg q4 weeks. Total body fat mass decreased up to 8.2% and spine bone mineral density increased up to 3.4% at doses of 2 mg/kg q4 weeks. Comclusions: Preliminary results from this multiple-dose study demonstrate that, in healthy subjects, ACE-031 is generally well-tolerated and has rapid and sustained effects on muscle, fat and bone. These results support further studies of ACE-031 in neuromuscular diseases; a phase 2 study of ACE-031 in DMD is ongoing. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN11L_P04.019","Secondary Outcome Measures: To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of multiple, escalating doses of ACE-031 [ Time Frame: 6.5 months ].

A single ascending-dose study of muscle regulator ACE-031 in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: ACE-031 was generally well-tolerated. Adverse events included injection site erythema. Mean ACE-031 AUC(0-8) and C(max) increased linearly with dose; mean T(½) was 10-15 days. Statistically significant increases in mean total body lean mass (3.3%; P = 0.03, by DXA) and thigh muscle volume (5.1%; P = 0.03, by MRI) were observed at day 29 in the 3 mg/kg group. Statistically significant changes in serum biomarkers suggest ACE-031 also improved bone and fat metabolism.

Sherman ACE-031 Significantly Increases Lean Body Mass and Muscle Volume in Healthy Postmenopausal Volunteers Following a Single Subcutaneous Dose Resuts: ACE-031 was safe and well tolerated, exhibited a linear PK profile and t1/2 ranging from 10-15 days. Increases in lean body mass were observed as early as 15 days following single SC dose ACE-031 administration with mean %change from baseline of 2.5% (p=0.02) and 2.6% (p=0.01) at 1 and 3 mg/kg respectively, versus 0.8% (p=0.38) for placebo. This effect on LBM was maintained at 2 months post treatment (mean %change from baseline of 2.4% (p=0.09) and 2.6% (p=0.06) for 1 and 3 mg/kg respectively, versus -0.2% (p=0.84) for placebo). In subjects treated with 1 and 3 mg/kg, thigh muscle volume as measured by MRI at Day 29 increased from baseline by 3.5% (p=0.06) and 5.1% (p=0.03), respectively, whereas placebo subjects decreased by 0.2%. Increase in thigh muscle volume was statistically different between 3 mg/kg group and placebo (p<0.05). Changes in serum biomarkers of pharmacologic activity were also observed, including increases in adiponectin and decreases in leptin levels consistent with increased fat metabolism. Conclusions: These data support the development of ACE-031 in patients with neuromuscular diseases such as DMD, FSHD and ALS by potentially increasing muscle strength and improving physical function. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_IN6-1.004; December 8, 2009 Presented at 20th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2009, Berlin, Germany Abstract#LB348 BORGSTEIN NG, CONDON CH, YANG Y., WILSON DM, HALTOM E, LACHEY JL, SEEHRA J, SHERMAN ML Preliminary Results From A First-In-Human Study With Ace-031, A Novel Agent To Increase Skeletal Muscle, In Healthy Volunteers.

There were no serious adverse events. Two subjects in cohort 2 discontinued the drug due to constipation. The most frequent drug-related adverse event was gastrointestinal (40%). Cramp frequency decreased by 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39%-70.8%) and severity decreased by 46.3% (95% CI, 29.5-63.3%), which appeared to be dose-dependent, with decreased awakening due to cramps. Other outcomes showed no change. Discussion: Ranolazine was well tolerated in ALS up to 2000 mg/day, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most frequent.

Results: The 10 patients enrolled at the time of this report were mostly male (81%), and middle aged (median 53 years). There were no serious adverse events. One subject in cohort 2 discontinued the drug due to constipation. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal (38%). QTc and CK did not change from baseline to week 6. Cramp frequency reduced by 44% (p=0.01) and severity decreased by 36% (p=0.002), accompanied by decreased awakening due to cramps (74%, p=0.08), and decreased frequency of cramps interfering with daily activities or causing activity avoidance. Fasciculations, cramp potential duration, ALSFRS-r and FVC did not change. Conclusions: Ranolazine was well tolerated in ALS up to 2000 mg daily with gastrointestinal side effects being the most frequent. Ranolazine reduced cramp frequency and severity without significant effect on fasciculations, ALSFRS-r or FVC.

The large group of intermediate to fast progressing ALS patients showed a prolonged survival in the rasagiline group compared to placebo after 6 and 12 months (p = 0.02, p = 0.04), and a reduced decline of ALSFRS-R after 18 months (p = 0.049). SNP genotypes in the MAOB gene and DRD2 gene did not show clear associations with rasagiline treatment effects. Conclusions: These results underline the need to consider individual disease progression at baseline in future ALS studies. Very slow disease progressors compromise the statistical power of studies with treatment durations of 12-18 months using clinical endpoints. Analysis of MAOB and DRD2 SNPs revealed no clear relationship to any outcome parameter. More insights are expected from future studies elucidating whether patients with DRD2CC genotype (Rs2283265) show a pronounced benefit from treatment with rasagiline, pointing to the opportunities precision medicine could open up for ALS patients in the future. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38240416/; February 3, 2021 EU Clinical Trials Register Results Summary EudraCT number: 2011-004482-32 Trial protocol: DE Global completion date: 28 Apr 2016 Results information Results version number: v1(current) This version publication date: 03 Feb 2021 First version publication date: 03 Feb 2021 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2011-004482-32/results; June 18, 2018 Lancet Neurol. 2018 Jun 18. pii: S1474-4422(18)30176-5.

Results: Between July 2, 2013, and Nov 11, 2014, 273 patients were screened for eligibility, and 252 patients were randomly assigned to receive rasagiline (n=127) or placebo (n=125). 126 patients taking rasagiline and 125 taking placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For the primary outcome, the survival probability at the end of the study was 0·43 (95% CI 0·25-0·59) in the rasagiline group (n=126) and 0·53 (0·43-0·62) in the placebo group (n=125). The estimated effect size (hazard ratio) was 0·91 (one-sided 97·5% CI -infinity to 1·34; p=0·31). Rasagiline was well tolerated, and most adverse events were due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression rather than treatment; the most frequent of these were dysphagia (32 [25%] taking rasagiline vs 24 [19%] taking placebo) and respiratory failure (25 [20%] vs 31 [25%]). Frequency of adverse events were comparable between both groups. Conclusion: Rasagiline was safe in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of survival, although post-hoc analysis suggested that rasagiline might modify disease progression in patients with an initial slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised greater than 0·5 points per month at baseline.

Simon Witzel , Jeffrey M Statland , Petra Steinacker , Markus Otto , Johannes Dorst , Joachim Schuster , Richard J Barohn , Albert C Ludolph Longitudinal course of neurofilament light chain levels in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-insights from a completed randomized controlled trial with rasagiline Results: Baseline NfL levels did not differ between the study arms and correlated with disease progression rates both pre-baseline (r = 0.64, p < 0.001) and during the study (r = 0.61, p < 0.001). NfL measured at months 6 and 12 did not change significantly from baseline in both arms, with a median individual NfL change of +1.4 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] -5.6, 14.2) across all follow-up time points. However, a significant difference in NfL change at month 12 was observed between patients with high and low NfL baseline levels treated with rasagiline (high [n = 13], -6.9 pg/mL, IQR -20.4, 6.0; low [n = 18], +5.9 pg/mL, IQR -1.4, 19.7; p = 0.025). Additionally, generally higher longitudinal NfL variability was observed in patients with high baseline levels, whereas disease progression rates and disease duration at baseline had no impact on the longitudinal NfL course. Conclusion: Post hoc NfL measurements in completed clinical trials are helpful in interpreting NfL data from ongoing and future interventional trials and could provide hypothesis-generating complementary insights. Further studies are warranted to ultimately differentiate NfL response to treatment from other factors. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37975796/ Full text https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.16154; January 27, 2020 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: January 27, 2020 Last Update Posted: January 27, 2020 Recruitment Details: No text entered Pre-assignment Details: No text entered Limitations and Caveats: Not specified Results: Tabular data available at source URL https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01786603; November 26, 2018 Muscle Nerve. 2019 Feb;59(2):201-207. doi: 10.1002/mus.26335.

Results: Participants experienced no serious drug-related adverse events, and the most common adverse event was nausea (11.1%). Rasagiline did not improve the rate of decline in the ALSFRS-R; however, differences in symptom duration compared to historical placebo controls differentially affected ALSFRS-R slope estimates. Rasagiline changed biomarkers over 12 months, such that the mitochondrial membrane potential increased (JC-1 red/green fluorescent ratio 1.92, p = 0.0001) and apoptosis markers decreased (Bcl-2/Bax ratio 0.24, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In conclusion, engagement of exploratory biomarkers and questions about comparability of baseline characteristics lead us to recommend a further placebo-controlled trial. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832828 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/21678421.2015.1026826; Decmeber 07, 2013 Presented at the 24th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-8, 2013, Milan, Italy Session Type: POSTER SESSION B Session Title: THEME 11 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES Abstract No.: P311 MACCHI Z, WANG Y, MOORE D, DICK A, DIMACHKIE M, KATZ J, SAPERSTEIN D,LEVINE T, WALK D, SIMPSON E, GENGE A, BERTORINI T , FERNANDES J , SWENSON AJ ,ELMAN L , JACKSON C , LU J , HERBELIN L ,BAROHN RJ POSSIBLE MITOCHONDRIAL TARGET ENGAGEMENT IN AN OPEN-LABEL TRIAL OF RASAGILINE FOR ALS Results: Thirty-six patients enrolled at nine centers of the Western ALS study group and 23 patients completed 12 months of treatment. ALSFRS-R declined at a rate of 1.19 per month and was not significantly different from historical controls. Biomarker assays showed increased mitochondrial hyperpolarization (JC-1, fl uorescence ratio at baseline = 0.54, 6 months = 0.62, 12 months = 2.43; p = 0.05; Mitotracker, percent fluorescence at baseline = 18.05%, 6 months = 28.18%, 12 months = 67.67%; p < 0.05). Annexin showed a decrease in cell apoptosis (percent fluorescence at baseline = 29.4%, 6 months = 27.95%, 12 months = 22.72%; p < 0.05), Bcl/Bax ratio showed anti-apoptotic cell conditions (baseline = 0.03, 6 months = 0.05, 12 months = 0.27; p < 0.05), ORAC showed antioxidant protection against oxidative stress (baseline = 4834.92 µmol, 6 months = 6575.45 µ mol, 12 months = 5700.19 µmol; p < 0.05). Conclusion: We may have evidence of mitochondrial target engagement. Other explanations for the biomarker data also include: disease progression that may have changed the assay measurements, or technical components (equipment, experience, processing of samples). Inclusion of a placebo-treated group could help resolve this or, alternatively, re-measuring biomarker parameters after a drug wash-out period. This drug needs to be studied further in ALS and a Phase II placebo controlled trial is underway.

A Multicenter Screening Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Rasagiline in People with ALS Interim Results: Nine centers in the Western ALS (WALS) study group are participating in this study. Total 41 patients screened, 35 were enrolled and 30 remain on treatment with four dropouts due to either side effects (4), and one patient died. There were 18 men and 17 women, with a mean age at entry of 61 years (59-82), and mean disease duration was 1.5 years (0.5-3). 16 patients have been on rasagiline 2 mg for six months. The mean ALSFRS-R for these16 patient were: 37.2 baseline, 36,4 month 1, 32.5 month 6. Mean Jc-1 lymphocyte ratio was 0.46 relative fluorescence at baseline and 0.61 relative fluorescence at six months (P<0.02). Conclusions: Rasagiline appears to be safe in this ALS population.

Berry, MD, MPH Efficacy and Safety of Ravulizumab, a Complement C5 Inhibitor, in Adults With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial Results: A total of 382 participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ravulizumab (n = 255; mean [SD] age, 58.6 [10.6] years; 94 female [36.9%] and 161 male [63.1%]) or placebo (n = 127; mean [SD] age, 58.0 [11.0] years; 58 female [45.7%] and 69 male [54.3%]). The interim analysis showed that the observed mean change from baseline in ALSFRS-R at week 50 was -14.67 points (SE, 0.89 points; 95% CI, -16.42 to -12.91 points) for ravulizumab and -13.33 points (SE, 1.22 points; 95% CI, -15.72 to -10.93 points) for placebo, with no significant difference between the groups (mean [SE] difference, -1.34 [1.46] points; 95% CI, -4.21 to 1.53 points). Based on these data, the trial was terminated for futility. The primary analysis at week 50 showed no significant difference in CAFS between groups (mean [SE], 5.5 [10.8] points; 95% CI, -15.7 to 26.6 points; P = .61). Overall incidence rates for treatment-emergent adverse events were similar for ravulizumab (204 participants [80.0%]) and placebo (108 participants [85.0%]). Conclusions and relevance: This trial rapidly showed that terminal complement C5 inhibition with ravulizumab did not slow functional decline in participants with ALS and that the safety profiles of ravulizumab and placebo were similar. Highly effective, novel treatments are critically needed to slow functional decline and extend survival in patients with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37695623/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10495927/ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2809453; January 10, 2023 ClinicalTrials.gov Results Results First Posted: January 10, 2023 Last Update Posted: January 10, 2023 Recruitment Details: No data entered Pre-assignment Details: No data entered Limitations and Caveats: The IDMC recommended the study be discontinued due to lack of efficacy with ravulizumab.

ALSFRS-R,1,"November 15, 2023 ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-20 Hospitalizations in COURAGE-ALS and their relationship to ALS Results: Enrollment occurred from August 2021 through March 2023; 487 pALS were randomized (2:1) and dosed. The pALS in the trial on the termination date continued to be fol- lowed through their follow-up visit 4–6 weeks after last dose. By the data cut point, 110 hospitalizations had occurred in 86 pALS. Information on relationship to ALS was available for 106 hospitalizations: 78 were classified as HR-ALS, 22 HU-ALS, and 6 HI-ALS. The most common reasons for HR-ALS were respiratory events (42 in total, including infectious and non- infectious causes, initiation of noninvasive ventilation [n ¼ 13], and pulmonary embolism [n ¼ 6]) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement or malfunction (n ¼ 23). Five pALS were hospitalized with COVID-19, 4 deemed HU- ALS and 1 HR-ALS. Hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infections, muscle spasms, and colonic pseudo-obstruction were classified as HI-ALS. Conclusions: While most hospitalizations in COURAGE-ALS were HR-ALS, HU-ALS and HI-ALS also occurred. When using hospitalization as an endpoint in an ALS clinical trial, record- ing its relationship to ALS provides additional details to more fully characterize disease burden and clinical meaningfulness of the endpoint. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; March 31, 2023 [Press release] CYTOKINETICS ANNOUNCES COURAGE-ALS MET CRITERIA FOR FUTILITY AT SECOND INTERIM ANALYSIS - Company Plans to Discontinue the Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Reldesemtiv - After Data Monitoring Committee Found No Effect on Primary or Key Secondary Endpoints ..SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq: CYTK) today announced that the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for COURAGE-ALS (Clinical Outcomes Using Reldesemtiv on ALSFRS-R in a Global Evaluation in ALS), recently convened to conduct the second planned interim analysis of this Phase 3 clinical trial. The DMC reviewed unblinded data from COURAGE-ALS and recommended the discontinuation of the clinical trial due to futility, as it found no evidence of effect in patients treated with reldesemtiv relative to placebo on the primary endpoint of change from baseline to 24 weeks in ALSFRS-R or in key secondary endpoints. Given these results, study conduct in COURAGE-ALS will be concluding... ...The second interim analysis was triggered 24 weeks after at least one third of the planned sample size was randomized in COURAGE-ALS. At the interim analysis, approximately 460 patients had been randomized and over 200 had reached the 24-week assessment of the trial endpoints. This interim analysis assessed the primary and key secondary endpoints for potential futility as well as provided for a potential fixed increase in total enrollment, if it had been deemed necessary to augment the statistical power of the trial, or to continue the trial to its conclusion as planned. Cytokinetics intends to notify all regulatory agencies and clinical trial investigators involved in COURAGE-ALS of these interim findings. The full data set from this trial is being analyzed and more details will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting... ...COURAGE-ALS & COURAGE-ALS OLE: Trial Design COURAGE-ALS was a Phase 3, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of reldesemtiv designed to enroll approximately 555 patients with ALS. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 300 mg of reldesemtiv or matching placebo dosed orally twice daily for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week period in which all patients received 300 mg of reldesemtiv twice daily. Eligible patients were within the first two years of their first symptom of muscle weakness, had a vital capacity of ≥65% predicted, and a screening ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R) ≤44. Patients taking stable doses of edaravone and/or riluzole were permitted to enroll, and randomization was stratified accordingly. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to 24 weeks in ALSFRS-R. Secondary endpoints included combined assessment of ALSFRS-R total score, time to onset of respiratory insufficiency and survival time up to week 24 using a joint rank test; change from baseline to 24 weeks for vital capacity; ALSAQ-40; and bilateral handgrip strength. The trial included two planned unblinded interim analyses conducted by the Data Monitoring Committee. The first interim analysis assessed for futility, 12 weeks after approximately one-third or more of the planned sample size were randomized.

Key inclusion criteria in COURAGE-ALS include symptom onset within 24 months and ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score of =44. COURAGE-ALS began enrolling patients in August 2021, and 27 patients had been enrolled at the time of this analysis. The disease progression rate of each patient prior to enrollment was estimated using a formula based on ALSFRS-R score at entry into the trial and duration of ALS symptoms; progression rates were categorized as slow (< or = 0.37 points per month), middle (> 0.37–0.67 points per month) and fast (> 0.67 points per month). These categories were defined by equally dividing the disease progression rates of patients enrolled in FORTITUDE-ALS into tertiles. In COURAGE-ALS, the majority of the patients enrolled at the time of this analysis were middle progressors (48.2%) or fast progressors (37.0%). From this analysis it appears that adjusting the inclusion criteria in COURAGE-ALS is achieving the intended goal of increasing the proportion of patients with middle to fast disease progression rates, as compared to FORTITUDE-ALS... https://ir.cytokinetics.com//news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-data-its-als-program-presented-32nd","Secondary objectives: To assess the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on combined functional and survival outcomes in ALS To assess the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on ventilatory function To assess the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on quality of life To assess the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on handgrip strength Exploratory Objectives: To assess the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on the progression of ALS Secondary end point(s) Combined assessment of change in ALSFRS-R total score, time to onset of respiratory insufficiency, and survival time up to Week 24 Change from baseline to Week 24 in the percent predicted FVC Change from baseline to Week 24 in the ALSAQ-40 total score Change from baseline to Week 24 in handgrip strength (average of both hands) Exploratory Endpoints Time to first receipt, time to first use, time to daily use, time to dependence and number used of any of the following durable medical equipment items (manual wheelchair, power wheelchair, augmentative and alternative communication device, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and/or gastrostomy tube) from randomization to the end of the 24-week doubleblind, placebo-controlled period or to the end of the study Change from baseline to Week 24 in the four subdomain scores of the ALSFRS-R Time spent in each MiToS stage and number of patients to transition stages from baseline to Week 24 Change from baseline to Week 48 in ALSFRS-R total score Change from baseline to Week 48 in forced vital capacity (FVC) Combined assessment of change in ALSFRS-R total score, time to onset of respiratory insufficiency, and survival time up to Week 48 Change from baseline to Week 24 in the megascore of muscle strength measured by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) in bilateral first dorsal interosseous muscles, abductor pollicus brevis muscles, and abductor digiti minimi muscles Change from baseline to Week 24 and Week 48 in the EQ-5D-5L Change from baseline to Week 24 and Week 48 in the EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point 24 weeks for secondary objectives 48 weeks for exploratory objectives Secondary Outcome Measures : Effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on combined functional and survival outcomes in ALS [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] Combined assessment of change in ALSFRS-R total score, time to onset of respiratory insufficiency, and survival time up to Week 24.

Similarly, lower-extremity strength correlated well with ALSFRS-R gross motor domain and the ALSAQ-5 walking question. For SVC, correlation was poor with the ALSFRS-R respiratory domain, but stronger with the total score, potentially reflecting the insensitivity of the respiratory questions in the scale. Upper- and lower-extremity strength were both strong predictors of ALSFRS-R domain scores. Conclusions: In this analysis of data from an ALS clinical trial, muscle strength quantified by dynamometry was strongly correlated with functional capacity. These results suggest that muscle strength directly relates to specific functions of importance to people with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37641579/ Full text https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2023.2252468; May 30, 2023 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2023 May 30;1-12.

These participants most often had symptom onset ≤24 months and an ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score ≤44 at baseline. Compared with the overall FORTITUDE-ALS population, the subgroup meeting these criteria declined by fewer ALSFRS-R points at 12 weeks (difference of least-squares mean [SE] versus placebo 1.84 [0.49] and 0.87 [0.35] for the overall population). These inclusion criteria will be used for the phase 3 clinical trial, COURAGE-ALS, in which the primary outcome is the change in ALSFRS-R total score at week 24. We also measure durable medical equipment use and evaluate strength in muscles expected to change rapidly. To reduce participant burden, study visits are often remote, and strength evaluation is simplified to reduce time and effort. Conclusions: In COURAGE-ALS, the phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate reldesemtiv, the sensitivity of detecting a potential treatment effect may be increased by defining eligibility criteria that limit the proportion of participants who have slower disease progression. Implementing remote visits and simplifying strength measurements will reduce both site and participant burden. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37254449/ Full Text Available https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2023.2216223; Mar 31, 2023 [Post-hoc analysis] J Med Econ. 2023 Jan-Dec;26(1):488-493.

The difference in EQ-5D-5L utility least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline to week 12 for reldesemtiv versus placebo, adjusted for baseline values, was statistically significant (0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01, 0.05; p = .0008). The incremental QALY of reldesemtiv versus placebo adjusted for baseline utility values showed a modest, but statistically significant, difference (0.004, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.007; p = .0058). Conclusions: This post hoc analysis of FORTITUDE-ALS suggests that reldesemtiv showed a modest but significant benefit in health utilities and QALYs compared with placebo. Future long-term studies that include direct collection of EQ-5D-5L data will be needed to confirm our findings. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36930042/ Full text Url available at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2023.2192588 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13696998.2023.2192588?needAccess=true&role=button; December 8, 2022 [Press release] Cytokinetics presents data at the virtual 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND - Analysis from FORTITUDE-ALS Shows Predicted Survival Risk Score Strongly Correlated with Decline in ALSFRS-R SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq: CYTK) today announced that data were presented at the Virtual 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND related to survival predictions from FORTITUDE-ALS (Functional Outcomes in a Randomized Trial of Investigational Treatment with CK-2127107 to Understand Decline in Endpoints – in ALS), the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in ALS... Predicted Survival Risk Score for Participants in FORTITUDE-ALS Strongly Correlated with Decline in ALSFRS-R In a previously presented post-hoc analysis of disease progression in FORTITUDE-ALS, patients were grouped into tertiles according to their pre-study rate of decline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score. The largest treatment effect from reldesemtiv was observed in the intermediate and fast progressing tertiles. Most patients in these two tertiles had experienced symptoms for < or = 24 months and had a baseline ALSFRS-R total score < or = 44 (referred to as the 24/44 criteria). In this analysis, the ENCALS survival model was used to calculate a predicted survival risk score for all participants in FORTITUDE-ALS. The ENCALS survival model calculates the risk score based on several factors, including age at onset, onset site, cognition, vital capacity, El Escorial classification, diagnostic delay, C9orf72 expansion repeat, and decline in ALSFRS-R total score. Based on their risk score, participants were assigned to one of five risk groups based on predicted survival: very short (G1), short (G2), intermediate (G3), long (G4), and very long (G5). Among participants in FORTITUDE-ALS, the mean ENCALS risk score at baseline was similar for patients receiving reldesemtiv and for those receiving placebo, and there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of risk groups for those randomized to reldesemtiv compared to those randomized to placebo. When participants who met the 24/44 criteria (n=272) and those who did not (n=184) were categorized according to their ENCALS risk score, those who met the criteria were primarily in the G1, G2 or G3 groups associated with fast or intermediate progression and shorter predicted survival, whereas those who did not meet the criteria were primarily in the G4 and G5 risk groups associated with slow progression and longer survival. These findings suggest that ENCALS risk scores are strongly correlated with the rate of decline in the ALSFRS-R... https://ir.cytokinetics.com//news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-presents-data-virtual-33rd-international-symposium; November 17, 2022 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No.:CLT-23 ENCALS predictive survival model in FORTITUDE-ALS T. Simkins,, S. Kupfer, F. Malik, L. Meng, S. Rudnicki, J. Shefner, J. Wei, A. Wolff1 and R. van Eijk; Results: Mean RS for patients randomized to placebo was -4.65 ± 1.46 and to reldesemtiv 4.80 ± 1.85 (p ¼ 0.4136). For the FAS, 38 patients (8.3%) were in G1, 89 (19.5%) in G2, 106 (23.2%) in G3, 129 (28.3%) in G4, and 94 (20.6%) in G5. There was no statistically significant difference comparing group distribution for those on reldesemtiv compared to placebo. Comparing those in FORTITUDE-ALS who met the 24/44 criteria (N ¼ 272) to those who did not (N¼ 184), 38 (14.0%) who met criteria were in G1 compared to none in G1 who did not meet criteria (p < 0.0001); 81 (29.8%) who met criteria were in G2 compared to 8 (4.3%) who did not (p < 0.0001); 80 (29.4%) who met criteria were in G3 compared to 26 (14.1%) who did not (p ¼ 0.0002); 61 (22.4%) who met criteria were in G4 compared to 68 (37%) who did not (p ¼ 0.001); and 12 (4.4%) who met criteria were in G5 compared to 82 (44.6%) who did not (p < 0.0001). Discussion: In FORITUDE-ALS, baseline RS were well-balanced across treatment arms. In patients meeting the 24/44 criteria, there was a shift in the distribution of patients towards those with shorter predicted survival. Though the model is for survival, one would expect patients who have longer predicted survival would also have slower DFRS. In the ongoing COURAGE-ALS Phase 3trial of reldesemtiv in ALS, the goal is to maximize enrolment of patients with more rapidly progressive disease.

In FORTITUDE-ALS, secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline in the ALSFRS-R, in which higher scores represent better physical function, change from baseline in the ALS Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ-5), a patient reported measure of health status in which higher scores represent worse quality of life, and change from baseline in grip strength. Measurements for ALSFRS-R, ALSAQ-5, and bilateral grip strength were collected at Screening, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and Follow-up. For all seven time points collected, average grip strength was strongly correlated with the ALSFRS-R fine motor domain sub-score with an overall Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.723 (p < 0.0001), indicating that declining grip strength was strongly correlated with decreasing ALSFRS-R fine motor domain sub-scores. Average grip strength was moderately inversely correlated with scores for Question 2 of the ALSAQ-5, which assesses the patients’ perception of difficulty using their arms and hands, with an overall Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.634 (p < 0.0001), suggesting that declining grip strength was moderately correlated with increasing scores for Question 2 of the ALSAQ-5. These findings indicate that grip strength, which is frequently included as an outcome measure in ALS clinical trials and may be assessed as part of routine care for people with ALS, has clinical relevance due to its correlation to fine motor function and patient reported quality of life. FORTITUDE-ALS: Extremity Muscle Strength Correlated with Physical Function and Quality of Life Bill Jacobsen, M.D., Neurologist, Gregory W. Fulton ALS and Neuromuscular Disease Center and Assistant Professor, Department of Neurology at the Barrow Neurological Institute, presented an additional analysis from FORTITUDE-ALS exploring how muscle strength relates to functional status and quality of life. Muscle strength was measured using hand-held dynamometry in three upper extremity muscles and three lower extremity muscles, and the average strength of each muscle bilaterally was used for this analysis. Functional status was based on scores in the ALSFRS-R fine motor domain and gross motor domain. Quality of life was based on Question 1 of the ALSAQ-5, which assesses the patient’s perception of difficulty in standing up, as well as Question 2 of the ALSAQ-5. Each of these measurements were performed at Screening, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and Follow-up. Correlation was assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, defining scores of < 0.3 as very weak, 0.3–0.49 as weak, 0.5–0.69 as moderate, 0.7–0.8 as strong, and > 0.8 as very strong. Upper extremity muscle strength, individually and summed, was moderately to strongly correlated with the ALSFRS-R fine motor domain, and moderately inversely correlated with Question 2 of ALSAQ-5. Lower extremity muscle strength, individually and summed, was moderately correlated with the ALSFRS-R gross motor domain, and moderately inversely correlated with Question 1 of the ALSAQ-5. In general, summed relationships were stronger than those observed with individual muscles. Overall, these findings suggest that extremity muscle strength is moderately to strongly related to physical function and quality of life... https://ir.cytokinetics.com//news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-data-its-als-program-presented-32nd; November 17, 2021 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 22, Issue supplement 2, November 2021 Presented at the 32nd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 7-10, 2021, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2021 Abstract No. CLT-36 A.

Rudnicki Grip strength is more than a number: the relationship between grip strength and fine motor and arm function in FORTITUDE-ALS Results: The Spearman correlation coefficient for the FMDS and GSbh was 0.723 (p < 0.0001). The Spearman correlation coefficient for Question 2 of the ALSAQ-5 and GSbh was –0.634 (p < 0.0001). Patients with a FMDS of 0–2 had a mean GSbh of 4.97 + or - 7.02 lbs, FMDS of 3–5 had mean GSbh of 14.9 + or - 11.4 lbs, FMDS of 6–8 had mean GSbh 31.9 + or - 17.5 lbs and FMDS of 9–12 had a mean GSbh 53.2 + or - 23.1 lbs for both sexes combined. Similar patterns were seen for females and males, with higher values seen for men. The mean GSbh score was numerically lower with each drop of one point on the individual items of the fine motor domain; this was true for males, females, and both sexes combined. For the 44 patients whose baseline FMDS was 12, DH scores declined before CF or HW scores. When comparing the GSbh for items scored 3, 2, or 1, in general higher GSbh results were found for DH > CF > HW. Discussion: GSbh showed a strong correlation with the FMDS and a moderate correlation with patient perceived difficulty using their arms. These findings offer support that the GSbh has clinical and patient relevance as an outcome measure in ALS clinical trials.

Jacobsen, S. Kupfer, F. Malik, L. Meng, S. Rudnicki, J. Wei, A. Wolff and J. Shefner Relationship between quantitative strength changes and functional outcomes in the Phase 2 FORTITUDE-ALS Trial Results: The ALSAQ-5 item of activities of daily living and independence was well correlated with strength in all upper extremity muscles (Spearman’s correlation coefficients (SCC) ranging 0.6–0.7), while ALSAQ-5 item of physical mobility had moderate correlation with lower extremity muscle strength (SCC: 0.4–0.6). The ALSFRS-R FMD had a strong association with First Dorsal Interosseus, Wrist Extensors and Elbow Flexion strength (SCC:0.6–0.7). In the legs, the gross motor domain also had a somewhat strong correlation with Ankle Dorsiflexion and Hip Flexion (SCC 0.6) but the correlation was moderate with Knee Extension (SCC: 0.5). Moderate correlations were also found between the fine and gross motor domains of the ALSFRS-R with SCC of 0.5. Discussion: Overall, strength and function as measured by both ALSFRS-R and ALSAQ-5 were better correlated in the upper extremity than in the lower extremity. In general, averaging upper and lower extremity muscle strength resulted in higher correlations than single muscle groups. Beyond being an objective and quantitative measure of ALS progression, strength as measured using HHD is moderately to strongly related to functional capacity in ALS.

Post hoc analyses evaluated all reldesemtiv doses compared with placebo. Results: At least one DME item was prescribed and accepted by 33/114 (28.9%) of placebo patients, 19/112 (17.0%) of patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid, 24/113 (21.2%) receiving 300 mg bid, and 29/117 (24.8%) receiving 450 mg bid. The proportion of new DME-PAP was significantly lower in patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid vs placebo (17.0% vs 28.9%, p = 0.032). The hazard ratio versus placebo for accepting at least one DME item for all reldesemtiv doses combined was 0.61 (confidence interval: 0.39, 0.96, p = 0.032). 25% of placebo patients were prescribed and agreed to obtain a DME item by 84 days; this threshold was met for reldesemtiv-treated patients at 120 days. Conclusions: Results suggest ALS patients receiving reldesemtiv may have lower risk of and delayed need for DME related to impaired mobility, breathing, swallowing, or speaking; this delay is consistent with other measures indicating delay in disease progression. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218726/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2021.1946083; December 14, 2020 [Press release] Cytokinetics Announces Data And Trial Design Presented At The International Symposium On ALS/MND - Additional Data from FORTITUDE-ALS Support Rationale and Design for COURAGE-ALS, A Planned Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Reldesemtiv in Patients with ALS SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq: CYTK) today announced that additional data relating to the impact of patient characteristics on treatment effect in FORTITUDE-ALS, the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), were presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND... ...FORTITUDE-ALS: Effect of Reldesemtiv More Apparent in Faster Progressing Patients Jeremy Shefner, M.D., Ph.D., Lead Investigator of COURAGE-ALS, Professor and Chair of Neurology at Barrow Neurological Institute, and Professor and Executive Chair of Neurology at the University of Arizona, Phoenix, presented additional post-hoc analyses from FORTITUDE-ALS, the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS, evaluating how baseline patient characteristics impacted the effect of treatment with reldesemtiv versus placebo. When patients were divided into faster, middle and slower progressing tertiles based on pre-study ALSFRS-R progression rates, the middle and fastest progressing tertiles of patients combined showed a 27% difference at 12 weeks between patients receiving reldesemtiv versus placebo (1.15 ALSFRS-R points, p=0.011), compared to 18% (0.4 points; p=0.43) in the slowest progressing tertile. In general, patients with a longer symptom duration were slower progressors; 59% of those with SD >24 months were in the slowest tertile. Most patients who were minimally affected with an ALSFRS-R > or = to 45 at baseline were also slow progressors. In comparing the treatment effect of slow progressing patients with symptoms < or = to 24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of < or = to 44 to the original primary analysis population, the effect size and statistical significance increased, despite reducing the number of analyzed patients. In an analysis of the total study population (n=458), combining all patients who received reldesemtiv and comparing to those who received placebo, the change from baseline to week 12 in the ALSFRS-R total score showed a least square mean (LSM) difference of 0.87 (p = 0.013). However, limiting the analysis population to patients with symptoms < or = to 24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of < or = to 44 (n=272), the LSM difference was 1.84 (p = 0.0002). Together, these post-hoc analyses indicate that the impact of treatment with reldesemtiv was more apparent in patients with faster pre-study rates of progression, which include patients with short symptom duration and lower baseline ALSFRS-R scores... https://ir.cytokinetics.com//news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-data-and-trial-design-presented; November 5, 2020 [Additional analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 21, Issue supplement 2, November 2020 Presented at the 31st International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 9-11, 2020, Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 5, 2020 Abstract No.: CLT-17 Jeremy M Shefner, Jinsy A Andrews, Angela Genge, Carlayne Jackson, Noah Lechtzin, Timothy M Miller, Bettina M Cockroft, Fady I Malik, Lisa Meng, Jenny Wei, Andrew A Wolff, Stacy A Rudnicki Impact of Patient Characteristics on Effect Size in FORTITUDE-ALS Results: In general, static measures of disease state (such as baseline SVC and medications at baseline, and bulbar vs. spinal onset) did not predict impact of reldesemtiv. However, patients with faster pre-study ALSFRS-R progression rates showed larger treatment effects. The middle and fastest progressing tertiles of patients combined showed a 27% difference at 12 weeks between the reldesemtiv and placebo arms (1.15 ALSFRS-R points, p = 0.011), compared to 18% (0.4 points; p = 0.43) in the slowest progressing tertile. In general, patients with longer SD had slower progression; faster progressing patients had shorter SD; 59% of those with SD > 24 months were in the slowest tertile. In addition, the majority of minimally affected patients at baseline (ALSFRS-R > or = 45) were slow progressors (41/43 in the slowest tertile). In a post hoc analysis, we compared the treatment effect in patients with symptoms < or = 24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of < or = 44 to the original primary analysis population in FORTITUDE-ALS. The effect size and its statistical significance increased in this subgroup despite reducing the number of analyzed patients. For all patients randomized (n = 458), the change from baseline to Week 12 in the ALSFRS-R total score combining all reldesemtiv-treated patients compared to placebo showed a least square mean (LSM) difference of 0.87 (p = 0.013). Limiting the analysis to patients with symptoms < or = 24 months and a baseline ALSFRS-R score of < or = 44 (n = 272), the LSM difference was 1.84 (p = 0.0002). Conclusions: The impact of reldesemtiv was more apparent in patients with faster pre-study rates of progression. Short symptom duration and lower baseline ALSFRS-R scores are both correlates of faster progression rate. This is consistent with recent clinical trials in which stringent inclusion requirements limited study populations to early onset, faster progressing patients as slowly progressing patients may contribute little to detecting a treatment effect. Future studies of reldesemtiv in ALS will consider strategies to minimize but not exclude patients with slower pre-study disease progression to increase trial efficiency and sensitivity.

The primary analysis failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.11); secondary endpoints showed no statistically significant effects (ALSFRS-R, p = 0.09; muscle strength mega-score, p = 0.31). Post hoc analyses pooling all active reldesemtiv-treated patients compared against placebo showed trends toward benefit in all endpoints (progression rate for SVC, ALSFRS-R, and muscle strength mega-score (nominal p values of 0.10, 0.01 and 0.20 respectively)). Reldesemtiv was well tolerated, with nausea and fatigue being the most common side effects. A dose-dependent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted, and transaminase elevations were seen in approximately 5% of patients. Both hepatic and renal abnormalities trended toward resolution after study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: Although the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance, there were trends favoring reldesemtiv for all three endpoints, with effect sizes generally regarded as clinically important. Tolerability was good; modest hepatic and renal abnormalities were reversible. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969758/ Full text available at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2020.1822410; August 20, 2020 ClinicalTrials.gov Results: Results First Posted : August 20, 2020 Last Update Posted : September 11, 2020 Recruitment Details: Patients with familial or sporadic ALS were enrolled at 65 sites in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, and the United States.

The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in the following 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal). The total score ranges from 0 to 48. Higher scores reflect more normal function and lower scores reflect more impaired function. Slope of Muscle Strength Mega-score From Baseline to Week 12 [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 12 ] A hand-held dynamometer, with a scale of 0 to 300 pounds, was used to measure muscle strength and handgrip strength (bilateral). The muscle groups tested were: elbow flexion, wrist extension, first dorsal interosseous, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion; all muscle groups were evaluated bilaterally. For each postbaseline assessment of muscle strength, the percent change from baseline was calculated for each muscle group and handgrip strength, using the following equation: ([postbaseline value - baseline value] / baseline value) × 100. The muscle-strength mega-score was calculated as the average of the changes (ie, percent change from baseline) observed for each of the muscle groups as well as handgrip strength. For this endpoint, negative values indicate a decline in muscle strength. Secondary objectives of the trial To assess the effect of CK-2127107 versus placebo on measures of skeletal muscle function To assess the effect of CK-2127107 versus placebo on global function To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CK-2127107 administered orally to patients with ALS To evaluate the exposure of CK-2127107 and its metabolites, when administered orally in tablet form to patients with ALS in the fed state Secondary end point(s) Slope from baseline to Visit Week 12 in the mega-score of muscle strength measured by hand held dynamometry (HHD) and handgrip dynamometry Changed from baseline to Visit Week 12 in the ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R) The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) Plasma concentrations of CK-2127107 at the sampled time points during the study Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: At different time points throughout the study.

Holsten, Amber Ward, Lisa Ranzinger, Johnny Jones, Allison Newell-Sturdivant, Cynthia Lary; Early Treatment Effects of Riluzole in ALS: Isometric Strength Improvement in Sentinel Muscles Correlates with Improved Survival Results: 80/128 [ 62.5 % ] ALS patients showed improvement in one or more sentinel muscles following riluzole treatment and 48/128 [ 37.5 % ] ALS patients did not. Subjects in the ‘strength improved’ cohort demonstrated median survival = 21.0 months [ 95% CI =17.0 to 23.0 months ] that was significantly prolonged [ P=0.001 Kaplan-Meier Logrank test ] compared with the subjects in the ‘strength not improved’ cohort median survival = 12.0 months [ 95% CI = 5.0 to 18.0 months ]. Conclusions: A proportion of ALS patients receiving riluzole/vitamin E/vitamin B12/folic acid/vitamin D show improvement in isometric muscle strength in sentinel muscles observed within 4 weeks of treatment initiation that is associated with slower disease progression as measured by increased survival. Assessing early response to riluzole treatment may be an independent milestone that might be employed in prognostic models as well as prediction model based clinical trial analysis. Replication of this observation as well as further investigation of early non-responders with respect to riluzole pharmacokinetics may provide insights as to whether patients are treatment resistant or may need riluzole dose adjustment.

EMT decreased and EI increased signifi cantly (p 0.05) at the month12, but not at months 4 and 8. MEIM analysis, in particular at 50 kHz, pointed out signifi cantly (p 0.05) enhanced Rz and decreased Xc values month 8, and even more signifi cantly (p 0.01) both ones at month 12 (p 0.01). Conclusion: Data analysis suggests a significant correlation among MEIM, EI, EMT and disease progression, especially when the disease worsens rapidly. The Nyquist plot components are the earliest biomarkers for muscle decline during disease progression. Such fi ndings might be related to the likely initial re-innervation as a factor for maintenance of almost normal values for EI and EMT parameters, whereas the MEIM values that directly come from the muscle cell derangement (intramuscular fi brous and fatty tissue) alone, across the disease progression, precociously highlight pathophysiological condition. http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/21678421.2014.960174",,TrialTroveID-220907,,,,220907,,,"December 5, 2014 Data analysis suggests a significant correlation among MEIM, EI, EMT and disease progression, especially when the disease worsens rapidly http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/21678421.2014.960174",Iv,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",1,0,0,0,2,1,4,SURVIVAL,1,0,0,1

Strength-duration-time-constant, a marker of persistent sodium conductances was prolonged in ALS patients (p=0.01), superexcitability was increased (p=0.04), and accommodation to prolonged depolarising currents was reduced (p=0.01). Post-riluzole studies demonstrated significant reduction in the degree of refractoriness and duration of the relative refractory period (p<0.05), markers of inactivation of nodal transient sodium channels, with a trend towards reduced superexcitability. These changes were accompanied by significant increase in hyperpolarizing threshold-electrotonus (p<0.05). The pattern of change noted in post-riluzole studies was similar to that previously described in the setting of toxic blockade of sodium channels. Conclusions: The present study suggests that riluzole exerts an effect on axonal ion channel properties in peripheral nerves. The pattern of change suggests that riluzole may reduce nodal transient sodium conductances, which may contribute to the neuroprotective properties of riluzole, and reduction in fasciculation, as reported by ALS patients. http://www.aocn2012.com/abstract/143.asp",,TrialTroveID-171267,,,,171267,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

All patients were followed for up to 36 months. Demographics of Group 1 receiving riluzole for a mean of 8.6 + 3.6 mo at the time of baseline scan, age: 56.2 yr, symptom onset to baseline MRI scan: 20 mo; Group 2: 57.4 yr, symptom onset to baseline MRI scan: 29.8 mo. 16 deaths occurred at last follow-up of which 11 were in Group 1 and 5 in Group 2. Of these 16, 7 occurred within 6 months of the second MRI scan (early death). There was no differences in the loss of NAA/Cr, CST MTR, or C2 cord volume between the two groups or when the early demise subgroup was analyzed. Conclusions: We were unable to demonstrate an effect of riluzole on reducing tissue injury in ALS. It is possible that our ncMRI techniques are not sensitive to capture such an effect or there may be unknown mechanisms of action of riluzole at the cellular level. This deserves further investigation not only to better understand the effect of riluzole on motor neuron survival but also to develop biomarkers for therapeutic studies in ALS. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN10L_PD3.010",,TrialTroveID-125254,,,,125254,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Results: Both before and during riluzole treatment, 4 PALS showed severe, 3 PALS mild GH deficiency, and 3 PALS had a normal GH response. Mean peak GH concentrations were similar before and during riluzole therapy (13.4 +or-10.3 vs 14.2 +or- 10.1 ng/ml; p5NS). No significant correlation was observed between GH levels and age, BMI, disease duration, severity or clinical form (bulbar vs spinal). Conclusions: Our data point out that GH secretion is reduced in PALS, and riluzole treatment does not interfere with GH secretion. Therefore, evaluation of GH secretion in PALS can also be performed without withdrawing riluzole. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=922",,TrialTroveID-122005,,,,122005,,,,Other,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Riluzole and D-amphetamine interactions in humans. Results: On the SART, d-amphetamine enhanced the speed of correct responses but also significantly increased the number of errors of commission. Riluzole at 100 mg did not block, the typical subjective and physiological responses to 20 mg D-amphetamine. Riluzole alone induced amphetamine-like subjective responses. On the SART test, riluzole increased the number errors of commission, but unlike d-amphetamine, did not speed reaction time. Conclusions: The mechanism accounting for these findings is unclear, but may involve processes other than decreased glutamate release by riluzole. The effects of glutamate medications on psychostimulant responses need to be further examined. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17714844 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TBR-4NS2GNC-1&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9efe940f3af86738491e2284bb0e03ca&searchtype=a Full text available http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2259272/?tool=pubmed",,TrialTroveID-133693,,,,133693,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Hormone Measurements Efficacy > Hemodynamic Parameters Safety/Toxicity > Cardiac Measures/Events,,,Iii,,1,2,1,1,0,0,5,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

The tests will be the following: Electromyography (EMG). Graphic recording technique of the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG can be monitored through electrodes inserted into the muscles (intramuscular electrodes) or through electrodes on the surface of the skin over the muscle (superficial electrodes) with the FREE-EMG 300 Electromyograph (8 CHANNELS). This EMG is electromyographic data acquisition and analysis software. In this version, 8 acquisition channels are considered that allow the acquisition of EMG, Switch and / or Force Cell data. The graphical interface is designed for a 1280 x 1024 screen area. TEST MRC 11 –steps-mrc grading scale measures muscle strength Measurement of forced vital capacity (FVC): FVC is an indicator of lung capacity and would be obtained by performing spirometry, measuring it using a peak expiratory flow meter. Variables for cognitive and behavioral assessment: The assessment of cognitive and behavioral functions will try to determine possible improvements in these functions, linked to the damage that occurs in the frontotemporal area of ??the cortex in patients with ALS. To carry out these assessments, the following cognitive and behavioral tests will be applied. The tests will be: Edinburgh ELA Cognitive and Behavioral Exam (ECCE) A behavioral test-interview with the caregiver that asks questions with a dichotomous answer Y / N about the presence of uninhibited behavior, apathy or behavioral inertia, lack of sympathy or empathy, perseverative, stereotyped, compulsive or ritualistic behavior, as well as hyperorality and alteration of eating behavior. Likewise, it collects 3 questions about the possible presence of psychotic symptoms. -Variables related to the microbiota: A Clinical Intestinal Microbiome will be carried out, which is an analysis of the bacterial microbiota present in the intestine, from a stool sample. With this test the improvement will be assessed by the percentage of patients who present a increase of Akkermansia muciniphila, bifidobacterium or lactobacillus (the increase of any of the 3, especially the first); or a decrease in Escherichia coli or Ruminococcus torques (either of the two, but especially the second) at baseline, at 3 months (according to the investigator), and at 6 months. -Variables related to the quantity and quality of sleep: Clinical questionnaire for screening of sleep pathologies, hereinafter, sleep test (TS) Measurement through diaries (DS) and scales (ES) of multiple quantitative and qualitative sleep variables (Epworth Test (sleepiness) and Pittsburgh Test (sleep quality)). -Variables related to inflammation and oxidation: Quantitative measurement of plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha.

Compassionate Use of the ROCK Inhibitor Fasudil in Three Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Results: Between May 2017 and February 2019, one male (66 years old) and two female (62 and 68 years old) subjects with probable or definite ALS according to the El Escorial criteria (one of the females having a pathogenic SOD1 mutation) were administered Fasudil 30 mg intravenously twice daily over 45 min on 20 consecutive working days. Blood pressure, heart rate and routine laboratory tests were constantly controlled. All three subjects tolerated the Fasudil infusions well without any obvious side effects.Interestingly, the slow vital capacity showed a significant increase in one of the patients.

Discussion and conclusion: We showed the effects of a single dose of retigabine on axonal excitability, including parameters that have been shown to be abnormal in ALS patients. These effects were in a direction towards healthy controls (SDTC, refractoriness). Although a previous study in treatment-naive patients showed an effect of riluzole on refractoriness and superexcitability after on average 6 weeks treatment (6), our study did not show such effects, possibly due to the single dose setting, insufficient wash-out of the effect of riluzole in our nontreatment-naive patients, or up-regulation of efflux pumps at the site of action in later stages of the disease (7). As hyperexcitability in ALS is related to survival, retigabine may have the potential to (partially) reverse these changes and impact disease progression.

Results: Long term and individually adapted treatment with G-CSF was well tolerated and safe. G-CSF led to a significant mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral blood. Higher mobilization capacity was associated with prolonged survival. Initial levels of serum cytokines, such as MDC, TNF-beta, IL-7, IL-16, and Tie-2 were significantly associated with survival. Continued application of G-CSF led to persistent alterations in serum cytokines and ongoing measurements revealed the multifaceted effects of G-CSF. Conclusions: G-CSF treatment is feasible and safe for ALS patients. It may exert its beneficial effects through neuroprotective and -regenerative activities, mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as angiogenic factors. These cytokines may serve as prognostic markers when measured at the time of diagnosis. Hematopoietic stem cell numbers and cytokine levels are altered by ongoing G-CSF application and may potentially serve as treatment biomarkers for early monitoring of G-CSF treatment efficacy in ALS in future clinical trials. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534107 Full text is available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275232/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00971/full http://indexsmart.mirasmart.com/AAN2019/PDFfiles/AAN2019-003462.pdf https://n.neurology.org/content/92/15_Supplement/P1.4-020; November 7, 2017 Amyotrophic and Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 18, S2, Pages 1-337, Published online: 7 Nov 2017 Presented at the 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2017, Boston, MA Abstract No. CW-03 U Bogdahn, S Johannesen, T-H Bruun, O Hsan, A-L Meyer, A-M Wirth, I Kobor, W Schulte-Mattler, B Budeus, A Schneider, W Koch, A Ferguson, R Huie; Biomarker supervised filgrastim (G-CSF) response in ALS patients Results: Safety, feasibility and tolerance were excellent. Adjusted (for: age, sex, ALS-FRS-R at baseline, riluzole use, site of onset, time-lapse from diagnosis to therapy) multi parameter survival analysis revealed a significant benefit (p = 0.018) with an HR of 0.58 in favour of G-CSF compared to PROACT. A ‘matched-pair’ analysis (25 PROACT points vs 1 G-CSF pat, bootstrapping, and leave-one-out procedure x 10^4 ) resulted in a significant difference with a median of 367 (PRO-ACT) vs 609 (G-CSF) days survival. Differences between observed to predicted survival times were significantly in favour of G-CSF (Wilcoxon/Kruskal Wallis Test, 2-Sample Test p < 0.0001*, 1-Way Test, Chi Square Approximation p < 0.0001*). Biomarkers correlated to prognosis and also to G-CSF response, observed in individual patients. Individual response was significantly associated to AUC (area under the curve) of patients’ own stem cell mobilization (p < 0.0273 - normal approx. 2 sample test, p < 0.0243 chi square approx.) Biomarkers analysis investigated a G-CSF response effect, as well as a highly responsive subgroup of ALS patients. Discussion and conclusions: Long-time G-CSF therapy in ALS patients seems very encouraging. Biomarkers to supervise this immune modulatory and stem cell activating therapy need further validation, at best within a prospective clinical trial.

Results: Safety and compliance were excellent. G-CSF was well tolerated and resulted in effective hematopoietic stem cell mobilization. Survival in our patients correlated to colony forming capacity ( p 5 0.0133) and mobilization of hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells ( p 5 0.0067). G- CSF has immunomodulatory properties, and resulted in modulation of several immune parameters over time, amongst others mobilization of monocytes correlated to survival ( p 5 0.05). Furthermore, decline in DTI-based FA values along the CST ( p 5 0.0001) and also MUNIX of ADM ( p 5 0.0001) correlated to ALSFRS-R. We observed a significantly lower ALS progression rate (ALSFRS-R decline 3.2/yr vs. 7.3/yr, p 5 0.0001) and a clinically relevant prolongation of survival (median survival 726d vs. 337d, p 5 0.0005) when comparing G-CSF to the PRO- ACT database. The odds ratio of survival with G-CSF over PRO-ACT was 2.78 ( p 5 0.0001). The effect on ALSFRS-R and survival was dose-dependent (both p 5 0.0001). Discussion and conclusions: Long-term administration of G-CSF in ALS patients is safe and well tolerated. We observed a dose dependent delay in clinical deterioration and prolongation in survival when comparing to the PRO- ACT database. Our obtained data encourage determina tion of mode of action and possible biomarkers.

G-CSF was well tolerated, although acceptable mild or moderate bone pain was frequently reported. G-CSF resulted in effective hematopoietic stem cell mobilization (increase in CD34+ and CD34+38- cells). We found bone marrow colony forming capacity with G-CSF treatment to be associated to overall survival (OS). In retrospective analysis a significantly lower ALS progression rate (p<0.0001) and a clinically relevant prolongation of OS (p<0.0001) were observed in long-term G-CSF treated ALS patients compared to the current PRO-ACT database. Without respect to dosage, median OS since G-CSF treatment initiation was 28,5 months. Conclusions: Long-term administration of G-CSF in ALS patients is safe, well tolerated and feasible. Data are very robust; a prospective clinical trial is urgently needed. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4046/presentation/7490; June 20, 2015 Presented at 1st Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, June 20-23, 2015, Berlin, Germany Session Type # Poster presentation with discussion Session title # Motor neurone diseases 1 Abstract ID # P1137 S.

Bogdahn Biomarker Discovery, Safety and Feasibility of G-CSF Compassionate use in ALS Patients Results: Safety and compliance were excellent, G-CSF was well tolerated. G-CSF resulted in effective hematopoietic stem cell mobilization. Disease progression correlated significantly (p<0,0001) with i-MUNIX, and as trend with FA. During disease progression patients with lower ALS-FRS-r mobilized less monocytes and CD34+38- stem cells, but more eosinophils. Colony Forming Units for bone marrow stem cell potential were further analyzed. In retrospective analysis a significant decrease in ALS progression rate and clinical relevant prolongation of overall survival of G-CSF patients in comparison to the current Pro-ACT database indicates high safety of prolonged G-CSF treatment. Conclusion: Long-term administration of G-CSF in ALS patients is safe and feasible. i-MUNIX, FA, and bone marrow differentiation parameters are very promising biomarkers for ALS treatment development.

Both modes of delivery resulted in hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and biomarker modulation. We found no evidence of premalignant changes in bone marrow differentiation. In retrospective analysis a significant decrease in ALS progression rate - ALS-FRS-r - and clinical relevant prolongation of overall survival in comparison to the current Pro-ACT database, indicate high safety of prolonged G-CSF treatment. Conclusions: Long-term administration of G-CSF in ALS patients is safe and feasible. Compliance of outpatient regimens is excellent. A prospective trial is very urgently needed. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN15L1_P6.009; April 23, 2015 Presented at the 67th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 18-25, 2015, Washington, DC Session Title: P6: Poster Session VI: Treatments, Therapeutics, and Biomarkers Poster Discussion Session Abstract No.: P6.005 Siw Johannesen, Andrei Khomenko, Dobri Baldaranov, Ines Kobor, Josefine Blume, Tim-Henrik Bruun, Jochen Grassinger, T. Kammermaier, Albert Ludolph, Michael Deppe, Gerhard Schuierer, Wilhelm Schulte-Mattler, Armin Schneider, Rico Laage, Ulrich Bogdahn Biomarker - Discovery in G-CSF mediated clinical ALS Stabilization Results: Disease progression correlated significantly (p<0,0001) with loss of lower motor neurons (i-MUNIX); there was a trend in correlating FAI with ALS-FRS-r decline. i-MUNIX was significantly more sensitive for disease progression than ALS-FRS-r. During disease progression patients with lower ALS-FRS-r mobilized less monocytes and CD34+38- stem cells, but more eosinophils. Colony Forming Units for bone marrow differentiation lines are further analyzed. Conclusions: i-MUNIX, DWI-MRI, and bone marrow differentiation parameters are very promising biomarkers for ALS-treatment development. Validating these biomarkers for disease progression and potential sensitivity of treatment efficacy estimation is ongoing. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN15L1_P6.005; April 28, 2014 Presented at the 66th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 26-May 3, 2014, Philadelphia, PA Session Title : P1: Poster Session I: Anterior Horn Cell Disease: Pathogenesis and Pathology Abstract No.: P1.082 Ines Kobor, Dobri Baldaranov,Andrei Khomenko,Siw Johannesen,Jochen Grassinger,Katja Kollewe,Susanne Petri,Jan Kassubek,Albert Ludolph,Michael Deppe,Gerhard Schuierer,Tim-Henrik Bruun,Wilhelm Schulte-Mattler,Ulrich Bogdahn Reporting Biomarkers in ALS: Experiences from a Pilot Compassionate Use Program Applying G-CSF - Mobilized Hematopoietic Stem Cells in ALS-Patients Results: Both application modes (A: 5/28d: mean 18 treatment cycles (4 - 34) / B: 1/7dx4: mean 14.7 cycles (7 - 23) were safe with no obvious differences in tolerance and mobilization efficacy. Side effects were very mild, tolerance was good. MUNE correlated to disease progression (p<0.01) and to DTI (p<0.003). BM function was heterogeneous and correlations with effects are still ongoing. Median overall survival from diagnosis was 2.5 years, with a 1-year mortality rate of 10%. Conclusion: Prolonged treatment with G-CSF seems feasible and safe in ALS patients - a prospective study is in preparation. In addition to patients' survival and ALS-FRS, quantitative surrogate parameters for upper and lower motor neuron integrity like DTI and MUNE/MUNIX are very useful biomarkers to accelerate drug development. Further validation is necessary. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN14L1_P1.082",,TrialTroveID-205567,,,,205567,Efficacy > Patient Assessment Instruments Efficacy > Imaging Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,"November 26, 2018 G-CSF treatment is feasible and safe for ALS patients. It may exert its beneficial effects through neuroprotective and -regenerative activities, mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as angiogenic factors. These cytokines may serve as prognostic markers when measured at the time of diagnosis. Hematopoietic stem cell numbers and cytokine levels are altered by ongoing G-CSF application and may potentially serve as treatment biomarkers for early monitoring of G-CSF treatment efficacy in ALS in future clinical trials. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534107 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275232/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00971/full",Ii,"Completed, Positive outcome/primary endpoint(s) met",3,5,0,1,0,0,9,SAFETY,1,0,0,1

Results: 55.6% of subjects were able to swallow safely by PAS standards both pre- and post-dose. One patient moved from the “safe” to “penetration” category. No patient had a score indicative of aspiration either pre- or post-dose. There was no evidence of deterioration of swallowing function post-dose, whether analyzing PAS by single worst score, sum of scores, or Steele’s 4-level category methods. There were no adverse events reported. Conclusions: A single dose of 50mg ROF had no detrimental effect, was well tolerated, and may represent an alternative administration route in individualsn with dysphagia.

To date 3 deaths of patients who started drug 2/25 on drug (8%) and 1/4 off drug (25%). Hypoaesthesia/ numbness and tingling are possible side effects of taking the sublingual Riluzole. All of our patients have reported some sort of sensation, whether it be the hypoaesthesia or tingling separately, or together, after administration of sublingual Riluzole. It typically effects the tongue (posterior region), lips and/or entire mouth, as well as the area under the tongue, where the capillaries are trandporting the absorbed drug.

Berman; A Phase 1 Study To Evaluate Bioequivalence Between Bhv-0223 40 Mg Zydis Sublingual Formulation And Riluzole 50 Mg Oral Tablet In Healthy Volunteers. Results: In Part I, BHV-0223 achieved area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration exposures of approximately 90% and 113%, respectively, compared to Rilutek. The 90% confidence intervals were within the 80%-125% range required by FDA for bioequivalence. Conversely, crushed generic Rilutek administered sublingually delivered AUC levels with a ratio of 6% compared to orally swallowed Rilutek. With regard to the assessment of a potential food effect, BHV-0223 demonstrated a fed-to-fasted ratio of 92% with respect to AUC levels. Conclusions: Sublingual BHV-0223 40 mg is bioequivalent to, and thus offers similar efficacy as, Rilutek 50 mg tablet taken orally; but also potentially increases usability and reduces burden on patients (no need to swallow and no negative food-effect requiring fasting based on AUC); improves safety/tolerability (lower risk of doserelated liver function abnormalities); and enhances the pharmacological profile (less PK variability). http://indexsmart.mirasmart.com/AAN2019/PDFfiles/AAN2019-001988.pdf https://n.neurology.org/content/92/15_Supplement/S5.005",,TrialTroveID-273966,,,,273966,,,,I,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

In addition, patients counted the number of one brand of paper handkerchiefs (Renova) used daily (mean of 3 consecutive days).",TrialTroveID-080389,"Primary outcome was rate of responders (improvement >50% on visual analogue scales (VAS) of severity and disability of sialorrhea) 1 month post-treatment. For this, the patients rated themselves by marking 2 lines, one representing the amount of disability caused by sialorrhea (ranging from none to all disability due to sialorrhea only), and another line representing the subjective amount of sialorrhea (range from none to impossible to think of drooling more).",Sixteen bulbar-onset ALS patients were treated. All patients completed the 4-week study period. One patient dropped-out after due to disease progression and failure to come for the week 12 evaluation. http://www.springerlink.com/content/p048670j108080nj/fulltext.pdf?page=2,,80389,Efficacy > Symptom Assessment (Patient Reported Outcomes),,,Iv,,2,0,2,0,0,0,4,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

Botulinum toxin A versus B in sialorrhea: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Results: Twenty-seven patients (15 ALS and 12 PD) were enrolled, fourteen completed the study. BoNT-A and BoNT-B treatments gave both subjective and objective improvements in all patients. The latency was significantly shorter after BoNT-B treatments (3.2 + or - 3.7 days) compared to BoNT-A (6.6 + or - 4.1 days; P = 0.002). The mean benefit duration was similar at 75 and 90 days for BoNT-A and BoNT-B, respectively (P = NS). The only toxin-related side effect was a change to saliva thickness. Conclusions: Either 250 U Dysport or 2500 U Neurobloc have similar effectiveness and safety in controlling sialorrhea. BoNT-B has a shorter latency and comparable duration. Cost analysis, considering the doses used in this study protocol favored BoNT-B treatment. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21259343 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.23473/abstract;jsessionid=1F22D5CE8E9096422358F4C62BE610D5.d03t01; September 13, 2009 Presented at the 13th Congress of the European Federation of Neurological Societies,September 12-15, 2009, Florence Italy Poster no: P1386 A.

Bentivoglio Botulinum Toxin Type A vs. Type B in Sialorrhea: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-blind, Cross-over Study in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: BoNT-A and BoNT-B treatments determined subjectively and measured benefit in all patients.The latency was significantly shorter after BoNT-B treatments compared to BoNT-A (p=0.001); the mean benefit duration was similar in the two treatment groups. The disease did not influence latency and efficacy of the treatment. However, the benefit duration was significantly shorter in theALS group than PD group (p=0.001).The only toxin-related side effect was saliva thickness, more frequent among ALS than PD patients. Conclusion: BoNT-A and B are effective and safe in treating sialorrhea in PD e ALS patients. BoNT-B is effective and safe as serotype A with more rapid effect and comparable duration thus confirming the higher affinity for the cholinergic autonomic terminals displayed by BoNT-B in previous clinical studies. http://www2.kenes.com/efns/timetable_sci/Documents/PS1_5_Movement%20disorders_page_162_195.pdf To access abstract use URL: http://www2.kenes.com/efns/timetable_sci/Pages/PosterOverview.aspx Select: Poster Session 1: Movement Disorders (34 pages) Scroll to P1386",,TrialTroveID-115413,,"Among 28 patients enrolled in the study, fourteen patients completed the study, 7 with PD and 7 with ALS. http://www2.kenes.com/efns/timetable_sci/Documents/PS1_5_Movement%20disorders_page_162_195.pdf",,115413,,,,Ii,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Limitations and Caveats: The study was limited by the COVID-19 outbreak that started in Italy in February 2020. The pandemic caused restrictions in terms of participant access to trial sites and limitations in the performance of respiratory function tests. This context led to missing visits and missing data. Also, the drug administration route that required weekly visits to the participating center, with significant discomfort for disabled patients.

Assessed biomarkers did not differ between arms. The mean rate of decline in FVC and the eating and drinking domain of ALSAQ-40 was slower in the RNS60 arm (FVC, difference 0.41 per week, standard error 0.16, p = 0.0101; ALSAQ-40, difference -0.19 per week, standard error 0.10, p = 0.0319). Adverse events were similar in the two arms. In a post hoc analysis, neurofilament light chain increased over time in bulbar onset placebo participants whilst remaining stable in those treated with RNS60. Conclusions: The positive effects of RNS60 on selected measures of respiratory and bulbar function warrant further investigation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36148821/ Full text https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.15573; November 17, 2022 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No C02 E.

Beghi, and RNS60study roup o Results from a randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of RNS60 in people with ALS Results: 147 participants, 99 women, and 48 men, aged 30–77 years were recruited. Spinal onset ALS was documented in 85.7% of cases. 37 participants (25.2%) did not complete the 48-weeks follow-up (13 died), 70.3% of whom occurred after treatment discontinuation. Candidate biomarkers did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the intention-totreat analysis, the mean rate of decline in FVC and the eating and drinking domains of the ALSAQ-40 scale was significantly slower in the RNS60 arm compared to placebo over a 24-week treatment period (FVC: 0.46 per week for RNS60, 0.87 per week for placebo, p ¼ 0.0101; ALSAQ-40: 0.19 per week for RNS60, 0.38 per week for placebo, p ¼ 0.0319). A significant difference in the rate of decrease of FEV1 between the two treatment groups was observed (0.45 per week for RNS60, 0.52 per week for placebo, p ¼ 0.0146) during the on-treatment period. AE was similar in the two arms. Discussion: RNS60 showed no effects on candidate biomarkers in people with ALS, but positive effects on measures of respiratory and bulbar functions. These findings support the need for further clinical trials of RNS60 in ALS, including earlier treatment, longer treatment periods, and additional measures of respiratory and bulbar function.

Cudkowicz RNS60 in ALS: Expanded Access Program Results: 49 participants with ALS have been enrolled and treated with RNS60. 28 participants have completed six months of RNS60 treatment, 12 participants have completed 12 months of treatment, 5 participants have completed 18 months of treatment, and 3 participants have completed 24 months of treatment. Average age at baseline was 60.8 and average ALSFRS-R at baseline was 19.7. 10 participants have died due to complications related to ALS disease progression. No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to RNS60 have occurred and no participants have withdrawn from the program due to drug-related adverse events. This EAP has been well-accepted by the participating ALS patients and their caregivers. Conclusions: This EAP demonstrates the feasibility of performing EAPs in ALS patients as a complimentary approach to controlled clinical trials that allow for the collection of longer-term safety data. Overall, tolerability for and compliance with RNS60 treatment was high, which demonstrates the feasibility of RNS60 treatment in a broad ALS population, particularly those in the advanced stages of ALS disease progression.

RESULTS: Sixteen participants with ALS received RNS60 and 13 (81%) completed 23 weeks of RNS60 treatment. There were no serious adverse events and no participants withdrew from the trial due to drug-related adverse events. There were no significant changes in the biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Long-term RNS60 administration was safe and well-tolerated. A large, multi-center, phase II trial of RNS60 is currently enrolling participants to test the effects of RNS60 on ALS biomarkers and disease progression. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30458059 Also available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mus.26385 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379136/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379136/pdf/nihms-998614.pdf",,NCT02525471 RNS60-01 TrialTroveID-263140,"Primary Outcome Measures: Safety as Measured by the Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events [ Time Frame: 28 weeks ] Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of adverse events over the course of 24 weeks of treatment plus the 4 week off-drug follow-up period (total of 28 weeks). Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered at Baseline (Day 0) and the 24th treatment was administered at Week 23 (Day 161), and a safety phone call performed at Week 28 (Day 196). Tolerability to Complete the Entire 24 Week Study on Study Drug [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] Tolerability will be defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 24-week study on study drug. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered at Week 23. Blood Biomarkers of Inflammation. [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] Selected biomarkers of inflammation were measured at Baseline and Week 23 on a sub-set of subjects. Biomarkers included IL-17 plasma levels and FOXP3 mRNA expression in whole blood, a marker of Treg function. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23). Change From Baseline in Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) Normalized to Whole Brain Mean (SUVR) at Approximately 60-90 Minutes Post Injection [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] Glial activation was estimated in a subset of participants by magnetic resonance positron emission tomography (MR-PET) using the [11C]-PBR28 ligand. The subset excludes individuals homozygous for the T/T allele of the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism (rs6971) associated with low affinity for [11C]-PBR28. Glial activation was quantified as a mean standardized uptake value (SUV) using PET images acquired 60 to 90 minutes post-injection of approximately 430 MBq [11C]-PBR28. FreeSurfer v6.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was employed to circumscribe a region of interest (ROI) defined anatomically as the precentral gyrus and the anterior portion of the paracentral lobule, bilaterally. SUV of the ROI was normalized to the SUV of the whole brain and expressed as a SUV ratio (SUVR) to control for inter-individual variability in the global [11C]-PBR28 PET signal. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 ( Clinical Outcome: Change in Pulmonary Function From Baseline to Week 23, Measured by Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) was determined using the slow VC method. Vital Capacity is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation. A subject's VC depends on their age, sex and height. The value is recorded as the Week 23 minus the Baseline of percent of predicted normal.Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23). Clinical Outcome: Change in Strength From Baseline to Week 23, Measured by Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) is a non-invasive device that allows measurements of isometric strength in 12 muscle groups of the arms and legs using a standard protocol (elbow and knee flexion and extension, grip, and dorsiflexion). Results are presented as Week 23 minus Baseline of percentages of predicted normal strength based on age, gender, height, and weight using normative data. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23). Clinical Outcome: Change in Functional Status Between Baseline and Week 23, Measured by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) [ Time Frame: 24 Weeks ] The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minute) ordinal rating scale used to determine a subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There are 12 questions, graded by the subject 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects change from Baseline to Week 23 in speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing. Per the protocol, the first treatment was administered on Day 0 (Baseline) and the 24th treatment was administered on Day 161 (Week 23).","Participant Flow Period Title: Overall Study RNS60 Started:24 Randomized/Treated: 16 Completed: 13 Not Completed: 11 Reason Not Completed Screen Failure: 6 Withdrawal by Subject: 4 Death: 1 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02525471; Twenty-four volunteers were assessed for eligibility; 18 eligible individuals were enrolled due to 6 screen failures.

Overall, the incidences of adverse events, most of which had been reported previously, were similar within both groups. Notably, the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders (mainly, temporary mild nausea and diarrhoea) was high at 76·9% in the ropinirole group (14·3% in the placebo group). Regarding the feasibility of verifying efficacy, there were no significant differences in the ALSFRS-R score and combined assessment of function and survival scores during the double-blind period for 6 months, while the participants in the ropinirole group had lived an additional 27·9 weeks without disease progression events compared with the placebo group (log-rank test, 95% confidence interval, 4·3–37·4) at 12 months (secondary outcome). Interpretation Ropinirole is safe and tolerable for patients with ALS and this trial indicates feasibility for a subsequent large-scale trial https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.05.21267266v1; May 20, 2021 Keio University; K Pharma [Press Release] Ropinirole hydrochloride may attenuate the disease progression of ALS In a new clinical trial (ROPALS trial), researchers from Keio University have found a novel drug to be safe and effective for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ...In a new randomized clinical Phase I/IIa trial, researchers from Keio University treated ALS patients with ropinirole, a drug often used to treat Parkinson’s disease. After a period of 1 year, they found the drug to be safe and, most importantly, to have a significant effect in functional and survival outcomes, slowing the progression of the disease. ...the researchers designed a Phase I/IIa randomized clinical trial and recruited 20 patients with ALS. Of these patients, 13 received ropinirole hydrochloride, and 7 received a placebo for a total of 48 weeks. While the primary goal of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug, the researchers also evaluated to what extent ropinirole could show beneficial effects on the functioning and survival of patients with ALS. The researchers found ropinirole to be well tolerated by the ALS patients overall. Adverse effects associated with ropinirole were mostly known side effects and included complaints related to the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. To assess the functioning of patients, the researchers applied several objective scoring systems. By comparing the scores of both groups, the researchers found that patients receiving ropinirole had less functional decline and were physically more active...Finally, the researchers evaluated disease progression and survival between both groups and found that patients receiving ropinirole again fared better than patients receiving the placebo. (Median survival: 50.3 weeks vs. 22.4 weeks) Importantly, patients in the ropinirole group took more than twice the time to reach their first disease progression event, which included death, disability, and respiratory failure. This suggests that ropinirole could slow down the progression of the disease. https://kpharma.co.jp/pdf/20210520_en.pdf; April 13, 2021 Neurology Journal, Volume 96, Issue Supplement 15, April 2021 Presented at the 73rd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 17-22, 2021, Virtual Meeting Online published date: April 13, 2021 Abstract No.: 096/1171 Shinichi Takahashi, Satoru Morimoto, Kensuke Okada, Yugaku Daté, Daisuke Ito, Jin Nakahara, Hideyuki Okano; Phase 1/2a, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of Ropinirole Hydrochloride Remedy for ALS (ROPALS trial) Based On The iPSC Drug Repositioning Results: A total of 29 patients have been recruited; 21 of these patients (13 men) are enrolled in the 24-week double-blind phase. At enrollment, the mean +/- SD disease duration was 20 +/- 11 months. ALSFRS-R score was 40 +/- 3 (3 +/- 1 reduction during the run-in period). The whole trial was completed in July 2020 and the results will be known by April 2021. Conclusions: Our trial will be a touchstone trial for iPSC-based drug repositioning and will provide promising data.

Benaim, S. Wang, S. Hamilton, D. Ando Plasmid gene transfer of zinc finger protein vegf-a transcription activator (SB-509) for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) - a phase 2 clinical trial Results: Forty-five subjects with ALS were treated with 2 doses of 60 mgs of SB-509 on Day 0 and Day 90 via bilateral IM injections at various muscle sites in the neck, upper arms and legs. Historical placebo controls were used from the Minocycline study data base matched by Muscle Manual Testing (MMT) at entry into the study. SB-509 was well-tolerated. There were 15 unrelated SAEs. To date, 28 subjects remain on study (1 death on study, 1 withdrawal after 1st dose, most subjects were lost to follow-up after the 2nd dose). Thirty-two subjects have reached Day 180 and 11 have reached Day 270. ITT population data on 37 subjects by Day 120 showed improved muscle strength by positive MMT slope in the lower extremities compared to the MMT matched Minocycline control group. Peroneal and ulnar motor amplitudes were measured on both sides in order to evaluate electrophysiology. Twelve peroneal motor amplitude measurements showed a 1.2 mV improvement compared to 49 peroneal amplitudes with a -2.2 mV decrease from baseline at Day 120. These changes in MMT and increased peroneal motor amplitude correlate with the larger amount of SB-509 delivered to the lower extremities compared to the upper extremities. Conclusions: Regional muscle strength slope improvements and improved peroneal motor amplitudes support additional testing of dose frequency/schedule focused treatment in a specific, clinically relevant motor function (e.g. ambulation or hand strength). http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=2554&cKey=acc0c2ab-4cfa-4fd9-9444-3299d273f2b5&sKey=16f0d1c8-64bb-45f3-8db0-afb2743080f3 http://apu.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/abstracts/am2010/poster_presentations/PosterPresentation_WedAM.pdf (Page 414/210)","Secondary Outcome Measures: To evaluate a) the effect of SB-509 on Forced Vital Capacity, Neurophysiologic Index, Manual Muscle Test, and survival. b) safety and tolerability of SB-509 in ALS. c) stem cell mobilization in subjects with ALS receiving SB-509.

In approximately 77% of cases, 5% scopolamine ointment was effective for sialorrhea. The side effects were observed in approximately 12% of patients. These were local rash (7); tensed sputum (4); dry mouth(4) and others(2). Although only one case complained of light headedness, otherwise there was no systemic side effect. Discussion and conclusion: Our result shows that the scopolamine ointment was useful for improvement of sialorrhea without severe side effects. We reported that in healthy subjects, blood scopolamine concentration was lower in the 5% scopolamine ointment group than the scopoderm TTS group. One possible explanation is that 5% scopolamine ointment shows it effects through the local site circulation, thus it causes less systemic side effects. In this point of view, 5% scopolamine ointment might have some advantages over a pasting agent (scopoderm TTS ).Our result shows that the scopolamine ointment was an effective, noninvasive, simple, reversible and easy method.

Phase 2 study of sodium phenylbutyrate in ALS. Results: Twenty-six participants completed the 20-week treatment phase. NaPB was safe and tolerable. No study deaths or clinically relevant laboratory changes occurred with NaPB treatment. Histone acetylation was decreased by approximately 50% in blood buffy-coat specimens at screening and was significantly increased after NaPB administration. Blood levels of NaPB and the primary metabolite, phenylacetate, increased with dosage. Conclusion: While the majority of subjects tolerated higher dosages of NaPB, the lowest dose (9 g/day), was therapeutically efficient in improving histone acetylation levels. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18688762?dopt=Abstract http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/17482960802320487; May 01, 2007 (Preliminary Results) Presented at the 59th annual meeting of American Academy of Neurology, Boston Scientific Sessions: Anterior Horn I (SubCategory - ALS: Clinical Studies) Abstract # [S06.002] Safety and Dose Escalating Study of Oral Sodium Phenylbutyrate in Subjects with ALS.

Fourteen of those subjects were able to tolerate the maximum dose (21 g/day) for the entire 8-week period. Twenty-five subjects attained the highest dose of 21 g/day; 4 attained a high dose of 18 g/day; 7 attained 15 g/day; and 4 reached 12 g/day. Fourteen subjects discontinued study medication early for the following reasons: 6 due to possibly related adverse events; 4 due to unlikely related adverse events; and 4 withdrew early due to unrelated personal situations. Conclusion/Relevance: NaPB is safe and tolerable for most subjects at dosages between 12 and 21 g/day. The dosage for a Phase II/III efficacy study in ALS will be chosen based on the final safety and tolerability data and the results of measures of NAPB bioactivity and levels. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2007boston/view.php?nu=AAN07L_S06.002&terms=","Secondary Outcome Measures The number of side effects at each dosage, including abnormalities in vital signs, physical examination, blood tests and EKGs, change in vital capacity (breathing function) and ALS functional rating scale.

St Pierre EVALUATION OF SINGLE DOSE AND STEADY STATE PHARMACOKINETICS AND SAFETY OF AMX0035 IN CAUCASIAN AND JAPANESE HEALTHY MALE AND FEMALE PARTICIPANTS. Results: There were 15 JAP (7 male [M], 8 female [F]) and 14 CAU (8 M, 6 F) PK evaluable participants. Following a single dose of AMX0035, PB was rapidly absorbed with Tmax around 0.5 hour while TURSO Tmax was around 4-6 hours in both ethnic groups. At steady state (Table 1), the respective geometric mean [%CV] Cmax and AUCinf of JAP PB (188.2 µg/mL [23] and 235.2 µg*h/mL [38]) were higher than those of CAU PB (154.0 µg/mL [34] and 169.4 µg*h/mL [26]). Similarly, Cmax and AUCinf of JAP TURSO (1.2 µg/mL [100] and 13.5 µg*h/mL [91]) were higher than those of CAU TURSO 1.0 [41] µg/mL and 10.3 µg*h/mL [44]. There was no PB and minimal TURSO accumulation as AUClast accumulation ratio was 0.84 and 1.7, respectively. PB and TURSO metabolic ratios were not affected by ethnic background. PB, TURSO, and their metabolites show relative increase of exposure in female and lower body weight subjects. However, following weight adjustment, exposure is similar between the two ethnic groups and between M and F within each group. T1/2 values for PB and TURSO were around 0.5 and 5 hours, respectively for both groups. No participants reported severe adverse events (AEs), or AEs leading to death. There were no clinically relevant findings for clinical safety lab results, vital signs, ECGs, or physical examinations. Conclusion: AMX0035 exposure was higher in JAP compared to CAU and in F compared to M in each ethnic group.

Initial learnings highlight unique challenges when ALS EAPs are sponsored by highly-regulated pharmaceutical companies as opposed to academic sites with philanthropic support. Site resources are required to successfully run EAPs; however, legal and regulatory considerations complicate pharmaceutical companies’ potential reimbursement of the costs that sites incur to administer EAPs. Administrative processes and regulatory requirements can create confusion for potential participants and sites. The importance of open and clear communication whenever feasible is highlighted by initial feedback from the ALS community, with feedback centering on addressing areas of uncertainty in the process (i.e. timeframe when sites are still undergoing activation and participants are not clear if they will have a spot). Additional community feedback also urges future EAPs to have as inclusive entry criteria as possible (i.e. remove criteria related to time from symptom onset and invasive mechanical ventilation) and expand data collection to capture comprehensive long-term efficacy and safety data. Discussion: ALS EAPs can be successfully launched without impacting enrolment of ongoing trials. Critical input and feedback were provided by people living with ALS and their caregivers in the development and ongoing implementation of this EAP, which has provided valuable input as challenges and new opportunities arise.

There were no significant differences in PB and TURSO peak, exposure, Tmax, and AR between males and females after multiple QD and BID doses of AMX0035. There were no effects of age and weight on the exposure parameters of PB, TURSO, and their metabolites. There were no clinically relevant findings for clinical safety lab results, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and physical examinations in the study. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences in peak and extent of exposure of TURSO, PB and its metabolites after single or multiple doses of AMX0035. There was no PB or TURSO accumulation at SS. Demographic characteristics (sex, age, and weight) did not have significant effect on peak and exposure of PB and TURSO. AMX0035 was generally well tolerated and safe for participants with ALS. https://ascpt2024.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SFFST1NXUlcyMTA0OQ&PosterID=642825&rnd=0.3735362&mode=posterInfo","Secondary Outcome Measures : Effect of demographic characteristics on blood concentration of PB and taurursodiol [ Time Frame: Between Day 1 and Day 40 ] Maximum plasma concentration - Cmax of PB and taurursodiolin relation to gender, body weight and age.

Adverse Events ALSFRS-R Mortality Safety and Tolerability,1,"March 08, 2024 [Press release] Amylyx Pharmaceuticals Announces Topline Results From Global Phase 3 PHOENIX Trial of AMX0035 in ALS - PHOENIX Study Did Not Meet Prespecified Primary or Secondary Endpoints - Data From 664-Participant Study Reinforce That AMX0035 is Generally Safe and Well-Tolerated - Within the Next Eight Weeks, Amylyx Will Continue to Engage With Regulatory Authorities and the ALS Community to Share Topline Data ....CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMLX) (“Amylyx” or the “Company”) today announced topline results from PHOENIX, a global, 48-week, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of AMX0035 (sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol [also known as ursodoxicoltaurine]; RELYVRIO® in the U.S., ALBRIOZA™ in Canada) in people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PHOENIX did not meet its primary endpoint of reaching statistical significance (p=0.667) as measured by change from baseline in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) total score at Week 48, nor was there statistical significance seen in secondary endpoints. Amylyx plans to present the data from PHOENIX at an upcoming medical meeting and will publish the results in a medical journal later this year. Amylyx will continue to engage with regulatory authorities and the broader ALS community, including ALS specialists and other multidisciplinary experts, people living with ALS, and advocates, to discuss the results from PHOENIX within the next eight weeks and make informed decisions... ...PHOENIX Study Results: The Phase 3 PHOENIX study enrolled 664 adults living with ALS. Participants were randomized three-to-two to receive either AMX0035 or placebo, with both treatment groups receiving standard-of-care. Continuation of a stable dosing regimen of riluzole and/or edaravone was permitted. PHOENIX did not meet the primary endpoint: There was no significant difference observed between participants treated with AMX0035 and placebo in ALSFRS-R total score change from baseline at Week 48 (p=0.667). No significant difference was observed in the subset of participants who met the CENTAUR trial criteria. There were also no significant differences observed across secondary endpoints. Consistent safety and tolerability profile: AMX0035 was well-tolerated in PHOENIX. There were no new safety signals, reinforcing the favorable and manageable safety profile observed with AMX0035 to date... https://www.amylyx.com/news/amylyx-pharmaceuticals-announces-topline-results-from-global-phase-3-phoenix-trial-of-amx0035-in-als; November 15, 2023 [Pooled analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-11 M.

Paganoni Preliminary experience with sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol in a United States Expanded Access Program Results: One hundred ninety-four participants with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (11.79) years were enrolled in 22 sites partic- ipating in the US EAP. Most were male (63%) and White (89%). Mean (SD) duration of PB&TURSO exposure was 4.3 (2.47) months; 33% of participants had >6 months of expos- ure. Overall, 63% of participants experienced an AE, and 11% experienced a serious AE (SAE). Permanent discontinuation of PB&TURSO due to an AE occurred in 19% of participants. Gastrointestinal AEs, including diarrhea (27%) and nausea (6%), were the most common AEs reported. Note that data are preliminary and subject to updates upon final data- base lock. Conclusions: The PB&TURSO US EAP was successfully imple- mented alongside the phase 3 PHOENIX trial. The safety and tolerability of PB&TURSO in this broader population of PLWALS was aligned with the PB&TURSO arm from the phase 2 CENTAUR trial in terms of SAE incidence (US EAP, 11%; CENTAUR, 12%), diarrhea being the most common AE (US EAP, 27%; CENTAUR, 25%), and discontinuations due to an AE (US EAP, 19%; CENTAUR, 20%). https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; November 15, 2023 [Interim results] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-10 J.

Initial learnings highlight unique challenges when ALS EAPs are sponsored by highly-regulated pharmaceutical companies as opposed to academic sites with philanthropic support. Site resources are required to successfully run EAPs; however, legal and regulatory considerations complicate pharmaceutical companies’ potential reimbursement of the costs that sites incur to administer EAPs. Administrative processes and regulatory requirements can create confusion for potential participants and sites. The importance of open and clear communication whenever feasible is highlighted by initial feedback from the ALS community, with feedback centering on addressing areas of uncertainty in the process (i.e. timeframe when sites are still undergoing activation and participants are not clear if they will have a spot). Additional community feedback also urges future EAPs to have as inclusive entry criteria as possible (i.e. remove criteria related to time from symptom onset and invasive mechanical ventilation) and expand data collection to capture comprehensive long-term efficacy and safety data. Discussion: ALS EAPs can be successfully launched without impacting enrolment of ongoing trials. Critical input and feedback were provided by people living with ALS and their caregivers in the development and ongoing implementation of this EAP, which has provided valuable input as challenges and new opportunities arise.

Median survival duration was 10.39 months longer in PB&TURSO-randomized participants from CENTAUR (23.54 months) versus historical controls (13.15 months; HR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.31–0.72; P=.00048). Conclusions: The results of this analysis suggest a greater survival benefit with PB&TURSO than seen on ITT analysis in CENTAUR. The survival benefit attributed to PB&TURSO in this analysis aligns with prior analyses using statistical models controlling for placebo-to-active crossover in CENTAUR. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2023/PDFfiles/AAN2023-001382.html; November 17, 2022 [Pooled Analysis] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No.:CLT-01 Independent expert review of cardiac adverse events and electrocardiographic abnormalities and parameters in a phase 2 trial of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (CENTAUR) S. Badri, J. Mason,, S. Paganoni,, J. Timmons, ,P. Yeramian and M. Cudkowic Results: A total of 137 participants were randomized (PB&TURSO, n ¼ 89; placebo, n ¼ 48), with 90 enrolling in the OLE phase. Of these, 121 participants (98 who received PB&TURSO during either/both phases, 44 who received lacebo in the randomized phase) had 418 electrocardiograms recorded during treatment. In the randomized phase, summary changes from baseline in heart rate, PR and QRS intervals, and QTcF were comparable between groups. Of 11 initially reported TECAEs in 10 participants receiving PB&TURSO in either phase, 8 TECAEs in 8 participants were independently assessed as valid TECAEs; the 3 events not included in the independent expert tally were either present at baseline (n ¼ 1) or had other identifiable causes (n ¼ 2). There were no reported TECAEs among participants receiving placebo. Of 22 electrocardiographic abnormalities initially reported in 17 participants receiving PB&TURSO in either phase, 10 abnormalities in 9 participants were independently validated as treatment-emergent findings. Of 6 electrocardiographic abnormalities initially reported in 4 participants receiving placebo, 1 abnormality in 1 participant was independently validated. Valid events were generally benign without untoward outcomes and as common as spontaneous events in the ALS population. Furthermore, after normalizing for treatment duration, number of electrocardiograms, and number of participants in each group (2:1 PB&TURSO vs placebo), TECAE and electrocardiogram abnormality frequency were comparable in both groups. Discussion: Based on findings from posttrial independent expert reviews of data from CENTAUR, we conclude that the incidence of cardiac adverse events was low. PB&TURSO was not responsible for any serious events of cardiac origin and was also unlikely the cause of any of the minor adverse events.

Sabrina Paganoni, Claire Watkins, Matthew Cawson, Suzanne Hendrix, Samuel P Dickson, Newman Knowlton, Jamie Timmons, Machelle Manuel, Merit Cudkowicz Survival Analyses From the CENTAUR Trial in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Evaluating the Impact of Treatment Crossover on Outcomes Results: Hazard ratios (95% CIs) of death for PB and TURSO versus participants initially on placebo were 0.57 (0.35-0.92) on ITT analysis and 0.39 (0.17-0.88) in the primary on-treatment RPSFTM analysis (P=0.023). Median ITT survival duration for PB and TURSO (25.8 months) was 6.9 months longer than placebo (18.9 months) on ITT analysis and 10.6 months longer than the median RPSFTM-adjusted survival duration for placebo (15.2 months). Median survival duration was 18.8 months longer in the PB and TURSO-randomized subgroup who continued into the OLE phase versus the placebo-randomized subgroup who did not continue into the OLE phase (P<0.0001), though OLE phase selection bias may have potentially confounded these results. Discussion: Similar to the prespecified ITT analysis, post hoc analyses adjusting for treatment crossover in CENTAUR showed a significant survival benefit for PB and TURSO. Such methods may provide clinical context for observed survival outcomes in future ALS crossover trials. This article is protected by copyright.

Yeramian, Merit Cudkowicz Safety of a Fixed-Dose Coformulation of Sodium Phenylbutyrate and Taurursodiol in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer’s Disease: Integrated Clinical Trials Experience Results: Mean (SD) ages were 57.7 (9.6) and 70.7 (7.5) years in CENTAUR and PEGASUS, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) incidence was similar between groups in the CENTAUR randomized phase (PB/TURSO, 97%; placebo, 96%); 77% reported > or = 1 TEAEs in the OLE phase. In PEGASUS, TEAEs occurred in 67% and 59% of the PB/TURSO and placebo groups, respectively. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were more frequent during initial PB/TURSO exposure (week < or = 3) in CENTAUR and accounted for the predominance of PB/TURSO-related TEAEs in PEGASUS. Incidence of cardiac events with PB/TURSO was low (CENTAUR, 8%; PEGASUS, 4%), and in both studies, electrocardiographic findings were similar between groups at baseline, with no clinically meaningful changes observed over the course of treatment. Conclusions: These findings support the PB/TURSO safety profile in ALS and AD. TEAE incidence was generally similar between PB/TURSO and placebo in both trials. PB/TURSO-associated TEAEs were mostly gastrointestinal, consistent with the known profiles for PB and TURSO. Findings in AD further elucidate the PB/TURSO safety profile, as TEAEs in CENTAUR appear to have been largely disease driven. An updated safety analysis (pooled and OLE data) will be presented. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2022/PDFfiles/AAN2022-000131.html; March 28, 2022 [Press release] Amylyx’s ALS Drug Brings Questions On Efficacy Data Robustness To US FDA Panel ... Open-Label Extension In the open-label extension, patients originally randomized to AMX0035 showed sustained benefit of treatment across ALSFRS-R, ATLIS, and SVC over 48 weeks, the company said. However, the FDA noted the primary endpoint in the open-label extension was safety, and open-label efficacy analyses are difficult to interpret for various reasons, including the potential for unblinding due to the AMX0035’s bitter taste and adverse GI effects, a high number of patients who did not continue into the open-label extension, and substantial patient drop out during the extension. In the long-term extension, there was a statistically significant increase in time to first death, hospitalization or permanent ventilation in the group originally randomized to AMX0035 versus placebo (difference = 4.8 months; HR = 0.62, p = 0.02), Amylyx reported. The agency disagreed with the lumping together of survival, hospitalization and tracheostomies into a single composite endpoint and said this composite was difficult to interpret. “Analyses of the three components of the composite survival endpoint were planned, but the death analysis was not given priority over the other two components of the composite (or the composite itself),” the agency said. “The division does not agree with the inclusion of tracheostomy or hospitalizations in the definition of survival, as there is considerable variation in clinical practice as to when to hospitalize a patient or perform a tracheostomy due to differences in standard of care by treating physicians and patient preference; tracheostomies may also be placed for the management of secretions."" In an overall survival analysis, patients randomized to AMX0035 led to a statistically significant survival benefit (median difference = 4.8 months, HR = 0.62, p = 0.03). However, the FDA said this focus on death alone, and the submission of a new supplementary survival SAP for the open-label extension, occurred after preliminary survival analyses of data from the double-blind and extension periods already had been viewed Calling the survival analysis exploratory, the agency said: “The overall lack of statistical persuasiveness of the survival benefit, as well as the lack of replication of the results raises concern that the modest survival benefit seen may potentially be due to underlying disease heterogeneity rather than an effect of the drug.” No Disagreement On Safety One thing FDA and Amylyx appear to agree on is AMX0035’s safety. The agency agreed there were no significant findings of concern in the treatment group relative to placebo, and review of serious adverse events and deaths did not identify any safety signals of concern attributable to AMX0035...

CENTAUR was a 24-week placebo-controlled study of 137 participants with ALS that evaluated the safety and efficacy of AMX0035. The study was led by Drs. Sabrina Paganoni and Merit Cudkowicz from the Healey Center for ALS at Mass General in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium. As previously reported, the study met its primary efficacy endpoint of slowing ALS as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Similar rates of adverse events were seen in the AMX0035 and placebo arms. An overall survival analysis from CENTAUR followed each participant for up to three years from the start of the trial regardless of whether or not they continued in the OLE part of CENTAUR. The analysis found that the group of participants randomized to AMX0035 at baseline had a 44% lower risk of death compared to the group who originally received placebo over the duration of follow-up (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92; P=0.023). “We are pleased to share detailed findings from CENTAUR demonstrating the positive results on function and survival from AMX0035 for people living with ALS,” said Sabrina Paganoni, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator of the CENTAUR trial, investigator at the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Mass General and Assistant Professor of PM&R at Harvard Medical School and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. “In addition, we are presenting new results from an analysis using the ENCALS survival prediction model. Use of this model has increased our understanding of AMX0035’s impact on survival and may be an invaluable tool for ALS clinicians and future trial designs.” In collaboration with TRICALS ALS researchers at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, including Leonard van den Berg, M.D., Ph.D., Henk-Jan Westeneng, M.D. and Ruben van Eijk, M.D., Ph.D., an analysis using the ENCALS survival prediction model was performed to produce survival predictions for individual participants in CENTAUR. These predictions were used to compare actual survival vs. predicted survival in CENTAUR which enrolled a fast-progressing patient population. Key Results from ENCALS Survival Prediction Model Analysis: AMX0035 and placebo groups were well-matched and had a similar prognosis at baseline Participants who received AMX0035 at baseline lived significantly longer than predicted by the model (25.0 vs. 13.5 months from randomization, respectively) Participants who received placebo at baseline (including participants who crossed over to the OLE and received AMX0035) showed longer survival than predicted in the model (18.4 vs. 12.0 months respectively) Participants who received placebo at baseline and did not cross over to the OLE did not show significant differences compared to the predictions of the model “We are thrilled to share the results from CENTAUR at the International Symposium on ALS/MND,” said Patrick Yeramian, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Amylyx. “The statistically significant results for the prespecified overall survival and functional analyses provide strong evidence for the benefit of AMX0035 in ALS. The exploratory natural history analysis using the ENCALS survival prediction model adds further confirmation. We are working hard to move this investigational product forward quickly in light of these promising results and will continue to update the ALS community on our progress.” The development and validation of the ENCALS survival prediction model using data from >10,000 European patients with ALS was described by Westeneng et al in 2018. The model is expected to perform similarly in a U.S. population and has been cross-validated across non-U.S. datasets. However, it has not yet been validated in a U.S. population and is considered exploratory.

Cudkowicza and CENTAUR Study Group Functional and long-term survival benefit of AMX0035 in ALS: results of the CENTAUR and OpenLabel Extension trials Results: Of 137 randomized participants (AMX0035: n ¼ 89 (ITT], 87 (mITT]; placebo: n ¼ 48 (ITT/mITT]), 98 were eligible for OLE enrollment and 90 (AMX0035: n ¼ 56; placebo: n ¼ 34) elected to enroll. Mean rate of ALSFRS-R total score decline over the randomized phase was slower with AMX0035 versus placebo (difference, 0.42 points/mo; 95% CI, 0.03–0.81; p ¼ 0.03). The mean hazard of death over the combined randomized and open-label phases was 44% lower in the group originally randomized to AMX0035 versus placebo (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92; p ¼ 0.023); median survival durations were 25.0 months (95% CI, 19.0–33.6 months) and 18.5 months (95% CI, 13.5–23.2 months), respectively. Early gastrointestinal Treatment Emerhent Adverse Events were more frequent with AMX0035 in the randomized phase and in participants originally randomized to placebo who initiated AMX0035 upon OLE entry. Conclusion: AMX0035 was generally safe and well tolerated, with associated gastrointestinal TEAEs occurring early. Treatment with AMX0035 showed both significant functional and survival benefits. CENTAUR met its primary end point, with significantly slower functional decline among participants who received AMX0035 as measured by ALSFRS-R total score over 24 weeks. Median overall survival was 6.5 months longer in the group randomized to AMX0035 treatment at CENTAUR baseline in a survival analysis incorporating all randomized participants over a nearly 3-year period after randomization.

YKL-40 (r of -0.21; p<0.0001) and CRP (r of -0.19; p=0.0002) concentration correlated with ALSFRS-R total score. CHIT1 levels were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: YKL-40 and CRP plasma levels were significantly reduced in participants with ALS receiving PB and TURSO in CENTAUR and correlated with disease progression. These findings suggest YKL-40 and CRP could be treatment-sensitive biomarkers in ALS, pending further confirmatory studies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38050066/; November 15, 2023 [Pooled analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-11 M. Manuel, A. Myrkalo, J. Timmons, E. Engel1,R. Mateja1, A. Yeo1, P. Green, R. Hebron,C. Orsulak, H. Phatak1and S. Paganoni Preliminary experience with sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol in a United States Expanded Access Program Results: One hundred ninety-four participants with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (11.79) years were enrolled in 22 sites partic- ipating in the US EAP. Most were male (63%) and White (89%). Mean (SD) duration of PB&TURSO exposure was 4.3 (2.47) months; 33% of participants had >6 months of expos- ure. Overall, 63% of participants experienced an AE, and 11% experienced a serious AE (SAE). Permanent discontinuation of PB&TURSO due to an AE occurred in 19% of participants. Gastrointestinal AEs, including diarrhea (27%) and nausea (6%), were the most common AEs reported. Note that data are preliminary and subject to updates upon final data- base lock. Conclusions: The PB&TURSO US EAP was successfully imple- mented alongside the phase 3 PHOENIX trial. The safety and tolerability of PB&TURSO in this broader population of PLWALS was aligned with the PB&TURSO arm from the phase 2 CENTAUR trial in terms of SAE incidence (US EAP, 11%; CENTAUR, 12%), diarrhea being the most common AE (US EAP, 27%; CENTAUR, 25%), and discontinuations due to an AE (US EAP, 19%; CENTAUR, 20%). https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260201?needAccess=true; November 15, 2023 [Additional Analysis] ALS/MND 2023 Online published date: November 15, 2023 Abstract No. CLT-30 R. van Eijk, F. Zhang, Y.Wu, R. Miller,L. Mehta, S. Paganoni and L. van den Berg; A joint model for assessing mortality-adjusted progression (MAP) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: application to clinical trials of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol Results: Seven deaths occurred during the 24-week period (PB&TURSO, n ¼ 5 [5.6%]; placebo, n ¼ 2 [4.2%]). The primary analysis in the ITT population (N ¼ 137, unadjusted for mor- tality) yielded a least-squares mean ALSFRS-R total score of 26.73 at Week 24 in the placebo arm and of 29.05 in the PB&TURSO arm; the respective MAP estimates were 26.72 and 29.04. Minimal differences after adjustment for death resulted in nearly identical treatment effect size: original ITT analysis, 2.32 points (95% CI 0.18–4.46; p ¼ 0.034) and MAP analysis, 2.31 points (95% CI 0.21–4.42; p ¼ 0.031), with slightly increased precision. Simulation results also demon- strated that the MAP estimate yields results similar to the pri- mary model. Conclusions: MAP offers an improved method to assess the treatment effect of ALS therapies on function while taking informative missing data due to death into account. Post hoc application of this model to data from CENTAUR yielded simi- lar results as the primary analysis, which was expected given that the incidence of death was low over the 24-week randomized phase. A similar MAP model is planned for the primary efficacy analysis in the ongoing phase 3 PHOENIX trial of PB&TURSO in ALS, with results anticipated in mid-2024.

Sabrina Paganoni 1 2, Melanie Quintana 3, Alexander V Sherman 1, Matteo Vestrucci 3, Yuehui Wu 4, Jamie Timmons 4, Merit Cudkowicz Analysis of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol survival effect in ALS using external controls Results: Baseline characteristics including propensity score-matched covariates were generally well balanced between CENTAUR PB and TURSO (n = 89) and PRO-ACT external control (n = 85) groups. Estimated median (IQR) OS was 23.54 (14.56-39.32) months in the CENTAUR PB and TURSO group and 13.15 (9.83-19.20) months in the PRO-ACT external control group; hazard of death was 52% lower in the former group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.72; p = 0.00048). Interpretation: This analysis suggests potentially greater survival benefit with PB and TURSO in ALS without placebo-to-active crossover than seen on ITT analysis in CENTAUR. Analyses using well-matched external controls may provide additional context for evaluating survival effects in future ALS trials. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37807839/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10723227/; September 9, 2023 [Pooled Analysis] Annals of Neurology, Volume 94, Issue Supplement 30, September 2023 ANA 2023 Abstract No. S180 Melissa R.

Two neurology journal clubs were run. The ?rst arti-cle was the CHANCE-2 trial in stroke1 and the second wasthe CENTAUR trial in ALS2. A total of 9 questions wereincluded between the two programs resulting in 526 neurolo-gists engaging with the programs and 1970 unique Q&Aviews. Each question received 3-4 different expert answers.There were 361 unique paper downloads between the twoprograms. One hundred thirty neurologists participated in thepolls associated with these programs. Question themesincluded whether outcomes were clinically meaningful, how toapply study ?ndings to patient care, and strategies for counsel-ing patients on side effects. Conclusion: theMednet JournalClub feature is an engaging and effective way to connect aca-demic and community neurologists to conduct journal clubsaround high impact publications in the ?eld of neurology.

Mehta, Y. Wu, R. Miller, J. Timmons, M. Kokic, S. Paganoni Assessing Primary Model Assumptions in CENTAUR Trial of Sodium Phenylbutyrate and Ursodoxicoltaurine in ALS Results: Primary analysis results were consistent in the mITT and ITT populations (Table 1). When both the shared baseline and linearity assumptions were removed, the ALSFRS-R estimated treatment effect was 2.15 (P=.03) as ALSFRS-R, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale– Revised; ITT, intention-to-treat; MAR, missing at random; mITT, modified intention-to-treat; MMRM, mixed model for repeated measures; SE, standard error; SOC, standard of care.compared to 2.32 (P=.03) using the prespecified model. The placebo-based imputation analysis reduced the treatment effect slightly, but remained consistent with the primary result. The MAP model resulted in a death-adjusted treatment difference for ALSFRS-R (2.37; P=.04) that was similar to the point estimate observed in the primary model (2.32; P=.03). Conclusion: All sensitivity analyses returned consistent findings, demonstrating that the primary estimate of treatment effect is robust.

(Nasdaq: AMLX) (“Amylyx” or the “Company”) today announced the publication of long-term survival analyses of the Phase 2 CENTAUR trial adjusting for treatment crossover of the placebo group. The post hoc analyses suggested a larger survival benefit for AMX0035 (sodium phenylbutyrate [PB] and taurursodiol [TURSO; also known as ursodoxicoltaurine]) when adjusting for placebo crossover ranging from 10.6 to 18.8 months compared with 6.9 months seen in the original prespecified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These results are published in the peer-reviewed medical journal, Muscle & Nerve... ... Survival analyses incorporated updated participant vital status information from the prior interim ITT analysis. The final dataset compared time to death (all-cause mortality) from the point of randomization in the Phase 2 CENTAUR trial through a cutoff date of July 20, 2020 (longest follow-up, 35 months after randomization) and the date of the final open-label extension (OLE) phase participant visit (March 1, 2021, up to 42 months after randomization). Vital status could be determined for all but one participant who was censored at the date of last follow-up. Post hoc analyses performed included a RPSFTM and subgroup analysis. As of the July 2020 cutoff date, results of the final overall survival ITT analysis showed a significantly longer median survival duration of 6.9 months in those originally randomized to AMX0035 compared to those originally randomized to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35–0.92; P=.023). At the March 2021 cutoff date, results showed a significantly lower hazard of death and longer median survival duration of 4.8 months in those originally randomized to AMX0035 compared to those originally randomized to placebo (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-1.00; P=.048). Results of the statistical methods that account for treatment crossover (RPSFTM and subgroup analyses) showed a greater survival benefit compared to ITT analysis. As of the July 2020 cutoff date, the observed median survival of 25.8 months in those originally randomized to AMX0035 compared to RPSFTM-adjusted median survival of 15.2 months in those originally randomized to placebo, a 10.6-month difference, with an HR of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.17–0.88; P=.023). The RPSFTM analysis models what the survival outcome from the placebo group would have been had participants not switched to AMX0035 in the OLE phase.

Sabrina Paganoni, Claire Watkins, Matthew Cawson, Suzanne Hendrix, Samuel P Dickson, Newman Knowlton, Jamie Timmons, Machelle Manuel, Merit Cudkowicz Survival Analyses From the CENTAUR Trial in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Evaluating the Impact of Treatment Crossover on Outcomes Results: Hazard ratios (95% CIs) of death for PB and TURSO versus participants initially on placebo were 0.57 (0.35-0.92) on ITT analysis and 0.39 (0.17-0.88) in the primary on-treatment RPSFTM analysis (P=0.023). Median ITT survival duration for PB and TURSO (25.8 months) was 6.9 months longer than placebo (18.9 months) on ITT analysis and 10.6 months longer than the median RPSFTM-adjusted survival duration for placebo (15.2 months). Median survival duration was 18.8 months longer in the PB and TURSO-randomized subgroup who continued into the OLE phase versus the placebo-randomized subgroup who did not continue into the OLE phase (P<0.0001), though OLE phase selection bias may have potentially confounded these results. Discussion: Similar to the prespecified ITT analysis, post hoc analyses adjusting for treatment crossover in CENTAUR showed a significant survival benefit for PB and TURSO. Such methods may provide clinical context for observed survival outcomes in future ALS crossover trials. This article is protected by copyright.

Yeramian, Merit Cudkowicz Safety of a Fixed-Dose Coformulation of Sodium Phenylbutyrate and Taurursodiol in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer’s Disease: Integrated Clinical Trials Experience Results: Mean (SD) ages were 57.7 (9.6) and 70.7 (7.5) years in CENTAUR and PEGASUS, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) incidence was similar between groups in the CENTAUR randomized phase (PB/TURSO, 97%; placebo, 96%); 77% reported > or = 1 TEAEs in the OLE phase. In PEGASUS, TEAEs occurred in 67% and 59% of the PB/TURSO and placebo groups, respectively. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were more frequent during initial PB/TURSO exposure (week < or = 3) in CENTAUR and accounted for the predominance of PB/TURSO-related TEAEs in PEGASUS. Incidence of cardiac events with PB/TURSO was low (CENTAUR, 8%; PEGASUS, 4%), and in both studies, electrocardiographic findings were similar between groups at baseline, with no clinically meaningful changes observed over the course of treatment. Conclusions: These findings support the PB/TURSO safety profile in ALS and AD. TEAE incidence was generally similar between PB/TURSO and placebo in both trials. PB/TURSO-associated TEAEs were mostly gastrointestinal, consistent with the known profiles for PB and TURSO. Findings in AD further elucidate the PB/TURSO safety profile, as TEAEs in CENTAUR appear to have been largely disease driven. An updated safety analysis (pooled and OLE data) will be presented. https://index.mirasmart.com/aan2022/PDFfiles/AAN2022-000131.html; April, 2, 2022 [Press release] Amylyx Pharmaceuticals Announces Oral Presentation of Safety and Tolerability Data on AMX0035 from Clinical Trials at 2022 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting - Summary of data from CENTAUR and PEGASUS showed AMX0035 was safe and well tolerated in clinical trials inamyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) - Majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with AMX0035 were gastrointestinal in both trials with no new safety signals identified - Findings help further clarify the safety profile of AMX0035 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMLX) (“Amylyx” or the “Company”) today announced the presentation of safety and tolerability data on AMX0035 (sodium phenylbutyrate [PB] and taurursodiol [TURSO; also known as ursodoxicoltaurine]) as assessed in the CENTAUR and PEGASUS clinical trials in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), respectively. The data support the overall safety profile of AMX0035 as findings from this analysis show adverse event incidence was generally similar between AMX0035 and placebo groups in both sets of trial participants. ...In the CENTAUR trial participants (AMX0035, n=89; placebo, n=48) completing the 24-week randomized phase were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension phase and receive AMX0035 (=132 weeks, week 24 reported)...Results of the summary of the clinical trials showed that: The majority of TEAEs associated with AMX0035 were gastrointestinal, consistent with the observed individual safety profiles of the components of AMX0035. In both trials, diarrhea and, to a lesser extent, abdominal discomfort/pain, abdominal distension, and dyspepsia were more frequent with AMX0035 versus placebo. No new safety signals were identified. While the majority of participants in the phase 2 studies experienced TEAEs, they were largely non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and assessed as unrelated to treatment with study medication. Findings in AD further elucidated the safety profile of AMX0035, as TEAEs in the CENTAUR trial appear to have been largely disease driven. Further comparison of the TEAEs across both trials suggests that the higher overall incidence of TEAEs in the CENTAUR trial was attributable to symptoms of natural ALS progression, namely muscular weakness and falls, which were among the most common TEAEs in CENTAUR. ...The abstract, “Safety of a Fixed-Dose Coformulation of Sodium Phenylbutyrate and Taurursodiol in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer’s Disease: Integrated Clinical Trials Experience,” was selected for an oral presentation in the ALS and Motor Neuron Disorders scientific session, and will be presented on Monday, April 4, 2022 (1:00-3:00 p.m. PT / 4:00-6:00 p.m. ET). About the CENTAUR Trial CENTAUR was a multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial in 137 participants with ALS encompassing a 6-month randomized placebo-controlled phase and an open-label long-term follow-up phase. The trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of reducing functional decline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Overall, reported rates of adverse events and discontinuations were similar between AMX0035 and placebo groups during the 24-week randomized phase; however, gastrointestinal events occurred with greater frequency (=2%) in the AMX0035 group. Detailed data from CENTAUR is published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and Muscle and Nerve. The CENTAUR trial was funded, in part, by the ALS ACT grant and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and was supported by The ALS Association, ALS Finding a Cure (a program of The Leandro P. Rizzuto Foundation), the Northeast ALS Consortium, and the Sean M.

It is designed to reduce neuronal death in persons with ALS by simultaneously mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The new drug application, which is undergoing priority review with a 29 June user fee goal date, is based on data from CENTAUR, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 137 patients with ALS. The randomized, controlled portion of the trial was 24 weeks, and this was followed by an open-label phase to further evaluate safety and efficacy in those who completed the randomized portion on AMX0035 or placebo. All participants in the open-label extension received AMX0035. The primary efficacy endpoint for the randomized, placebo-controlled portion was the rate of decline in total score on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale – Revised. The ALSFRS-R is the most widely used clinical scale in ALS treatment and care and is suggested as the preferred primary outcome in ALS trials in the FDA’s guidance on drug development for the disease, Amylyx said in the briefing document. AMX0035 met the pre-specified primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant (p = 0.034) slowing of disease progression as measured by the ALSFRS-R total score compared to placebo. The estimated least squares mean ALSFRS-R total score was 2.32 points higher at week 24 compared to placebo, and this equated to a rate of decline that was 25.3% less in patients randomized to AMX0035 versus placebo, the company said. A 20% slowing of ALSFRS-R is considered clinically meaningful, according to Amylyx. The FDA said that although the ALSFRS-R was appropriate as the primary endpoint of the study, the review division typically recommends a joint-rank analysis of the ALSFRS-R change from baseline and mortality as the primary analysis in ALS... ... Relying On Linearity Furthermore, the statistical evidence is not highly persuasive, the agency said, noting additional questions about the robustness of the result. “The applicant’s primary analysis (slope analysis) assumes linearity of ALSFRS-R over time. However, linearity over time is not established for the ALSFRS-R in patients with ALS and exploratory analyses raise questions about the validity of the linearity assumption,” the agency said, noting that a prespecified back-up analysis in the SAP showed a treatment difference of 1.68 with a p-value of 0.1134. Furthermore, the analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat population and excluded two patients who died on AMX0035 but did not have post-baseline ASLFRS-R measurements, which could lead to bias, the agency said. ""There was considerable missing data (17% on placebo/18% on drug were alive but missing ALSFRS-R Total Score values at Week 24), and the analysis relies on unverifiable missing data assumptions,” the agency said. Another point of concern is the higher proportion of patients in the AMX0035 arm who started on approved ALS drugs edaravone or riluzole after baseline. “These concomitant ALS treatment intercurrent events are difficult to correct for, and the primary analysis inclusion of data after these intercurrent events could have confounded the test for treatment effect,” the agency said. Another factor complicating interpretation of the study results is a randomization problem that resulted in the first 18 patients (13% of the overall sample size) being assigned to the AMX0035 arm...

Cudkowicz Long-term functional benefits and safety of a fixed-dose coformulation of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Results: A total of 137 participants were randomized (mITT, n = 135 [PB/TURSO, n = 87; placebo, n = 48]; randomized period safety [PB/TURSO, n = 89; placebo, n = 48]). Ninety of 98 eligible participants elected OLE period enrollment (started on PB/TURSO, n = 56; started on placebo, n = 34]). At week 48, estimated least squares mean (LSMEAN) (SE) ALSFRS-R total score was 21.61 (1.18) points among participants starting on PB/TURSO and 17.38 (1.54) points among participants starting on placebo (difference, 4.23 points; 95% CI, 0.56–7.90; p = 0.02). Estimated LSMEAN upper- and lowerlimb ATLIS scores were 7.83 (95% CI, 0.85–14.80; p = 0.03) and 4.74 (95% CI, -3.00–12.48; p = 0.23) points greater, respectively, in those starting on PB/TURSO. Estimated LSMEAN SVC was 10.66 percentage points higher in those starting on PB/TURSO (95% CI, 0.63–20.69; p = 0.04). The proportions of participants who experienced > or = treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the groups starting on PB/ TURSO and placebo, respectively, were 97% and 96% during the randomized period and 73% and 82% in the OLE period. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were more common in the first 3 weeks among participants receiving PB/TURSO in the randomized period and in participants switching from placebo to PB/TURSO in the OLE period. Discussion: Earlier initiation and longer duration of PB/ TURSO were associated with long-term functional benefit, as measured by slope of ALSFRS-R total score progression over 48 weeks. Improved retention of measures of upper-limb and respiratory muscle strength was also observed in those initiating PB/TURSO 24 weeks earlier. TEAEs attributable to PB/ TURSO were primarily gastrointestinal.

Safety analysis found that sodium selenate was safe and well tolerated, with no study withdrawals. Commonly reported mild-moderate adverse events were nail changes (n=6), muscles aches (n=4), headache, fatigue, hair loss and fall (n=3). Five patients reduced their dose to 10mg tds due to adverse events. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Analyses of efficacy data are ongoing. A mixed-effects analysis showed an overall small but significant decline on cognition and behaviour, including total NUCOG score (b=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.28--0.08) Cambridge Behavioural Index (b=0.32, 95% CI=0.18-0.46) and Carer Burden Scale score (b=0.1, 95% CI = 0.02-0.18). Percentage change in whole-brain volume from baseline to week 52 ranged from -0.26% to -6.51% (n=7 >-1.8%, n=4 <-1.8%). Plasma tau levels (n=6) did not change from baseline (3.73 + or - 0.26pg/mL) to week 52 (4.66 + or - 0.24pg/mL). CSF tau also showed no change from baseline (167.8+ or -11.2pg/mL) to week 52 (156.1 + or - 2.49pg/mL). Although not significant, the directional changes are in line with the proposed mechanism of sodium selenate. Exploratory analyses of “responders” (brain volume change >-1.8%, n=7) found no change in NUCOG total score (b=-0.03, 95% CI -0.14-0.07) or CBS score (b=-0.05, 95% CI -0.04-0.13) over time. Conclusion: Sodium selenate is safe and well tolerated in patients with bvFTD. Exploratory analyses indicate it may reduce atrophy and halt cognitive decline in a subset of bvFTD patients. Sodium selenate should be further investigated as a potential treatment for bvFTD, and biomarkers to identify the subset of “responder” patients explored. https://alz.confex.com/alz/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/50979 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35574563/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9070376/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9070376/pdf/TRC2-8-e12299.pdf; July 27, 2020 [Interim results] Presented at the Alzheimer's Association Virtual International Conference (AAIC), July 27-31, 2020, Amsterdam, Netherlands Online published date: July 27, 2020 Abstract No.: Lucy E.

Results: The NAA/(Cre + Cho) ratio decreased in all patients who completed the trial. No significant difference was noted between treated and placebo group. At baseline, although IGF-I levels were within the normal range, 73% of patients had GH deficiency, being severe in half of them. Compared with bulbar onset, spinal-onset patients showed more depressed GH response to the GHRH + arginine stimulation test (10.4 + or - 7.0 versus 15.5 + or - 8.1 ng/mL; p < 0.05). Insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] increased from 2.1 + or - 1.0 at baseline to 4.6 + or - 1.9 at 12 months (p < 0.001).

Preliminary analysis showed high sensitivity of MRS in evaluating neuronal loss in the rolandic region as compared to controls (NAA/Cre+Cho 1.360.12 vs 1.150.18, p<0.01). Data correlated with disease severity measured with ALSFRS-R (R= 0.52, p< 0.01). Nine severe adverse events were reported during treatment: death (7), tracheostomy (2). Conclusion/Relevance: 73% of ALS patients have reduced levels of GH, and more than one third show GH deficit. MRS of the rolandic region proved to be a sensitive marker of neuronal loss and correlates well with disease severity. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2009seattle/view.php?nu=AAN09L_P07.164","Secondary Outcome Measures: Difference in mortality between groups [ Time Frame: 12 months ] Difference in the ALS-FRS score (motor function scale) [ Time Frame: 0, 6, and 12 months after treatment start ] Difference in the SF-36 score (quality of life ) [ Time Frame: 0, 6, and 12 monthst after treatmetn start ] Safety and tolerability [ Time Frame: 12 months ] Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events and laboratory parameters: routine biochemistry, hematocrit, and urine analysis.",FARM53XBKT NCT00635960 SLA_GH_1 TrialTroveID-086066,"Primary Outcome Measures: Primary endpoint is the N-acetylaspartate/Creatine ratio in the motor cortex assessed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Souvenaid reduces behavioral deficits and improves social cognition skills in frontotemporal dementia: a proof-of-concept study. RESULTS: Treatment with Souvenaid was associated with a significant reduction of behavioral symptoms and an increase in Theory of Mind skills compared to placebo, which both returned to baseline when Souvenaid was discontinued. Souvenaid did not have an effect on executive functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of the potential of Souvenaid therapy for the treatment of behavioral disturbances and social cognition skills in FTD. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592742/ Also available at https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/369811 Full text available at http://www.academia.edu/17558588/Souvenaid_Reduces_Behavioral_Deficits_and_Improves_Social_Cognition_Skills_in_Frontotemporal_Dementia_A_Proof-of-Concept_Study",,TrialTroveID-315798,"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (total score), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) (total score), the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) (total score), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scale (total score) .

Kazantseva Toxoplasmosis Therapy of Patients with ALS Improves Results of Combined Use of Cyclosporine A and Optimal Barotherapy in Chamber Results: The use of Cyclosporine A in combination with barotherapy was accompanied by moderate regress of bulbar diturbances, by disappearance of fibrillation and by an increase of the muscle mass and power, while CD 95 decreased significantly. An increase in CD95 with the minimal curative effect was observed in 3 patients with high antibody titres to toxoplasmosis. Later all toxoplasmosis patients were administered a long-term Fansidar therapy. The analysis of the clinical effect and the duration of after-effect showed that could observed a more expressed improvement of the breathing function and a longer curative effect in the group of toxoplasmosis patients receiving Fansidar. Conclusion: Treatment of the persisting neuroinfection increased the efficacy of the therapy aimed at slowing down the ALS progression. http://www.abstractserver.com/adpd2013/planner/index.php?go=abstract&action=abstract_iplanner&print=0&absno=1013&ADPD2013=3v4tno57cb47h0rjn29sqehj1bko8c74&ADPD2013=3v4tno57cb47h0rjn29sqehj1bko8c74",,TrialTroveID-182938,,,,182938,,,,Iv,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0

Subjects entered the study at a mean age of 55.9 years; 65% of subjects were male. 16.1% of subjects had bulbar onset; mean time from fi rst symptom to study entry was 18.7 months. 83% of subjects were on riluzole while entering the study. The change in ALSFRS-R after 12 months of treatment was -12.4 pts in the placebo group, -13.1 points in the 75 mg/d group, and - 12.6 pts in the 150 mg/d group. These differences were not statistically signifi cant. Similarly, there were no differences in survival, strength, or pulmonary function between groups. While patients receiving active treatment had more adverse events than those receiving placebo, dropout rate was similar across groups; 28.6% dropout in placebo, 31.2% in the 75 mg/d group, and 30.6% in the 150 mg/d group. Dizziness, somnolence, and ataxia were noted more frequently in the active treatment groups in a dose related manner. Discussion and conclusions: Talampanel was not effective in altering disease progression in this trial. Given the neurological nature of the adverse events, as well as evidence from various animal models, it is apparent that the drug did in fact reach CNS targets. This study does not suggest that the glutamate pathway is a poor target for new therapies; however, pure ampa antagonists are unlikely to be of benefit.

Results: Decline in muscle strength was 15% less in talampanel treated subjects, and decline in ALSFRS was 30% slower in talampanel treated subjects. Talampanel was safe in subjects with ALS. Mortality rates (8% talampanel, 5% placebo) and drug discontinuation rates (25% talampanel, 16% placebo) were similar in active treatment and placebo groups. Dizziness and somnolence occurred significantly more often in talampanel treated subjects. Although no efficacy measure reached statistical significance, there was a repeated trend toward slower decline in ALSFRS and isometric muscle strength in talampanel treated subjects. Talampanel was well tolerated in subjects with ALS. Although certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the active treatment group, the rate of subject drop-out after nine months did not exceed that seen in other trials.

The present review narrates the characteristic features of nanovesicles including their blood-brain barrier permeability and ability to reach dopaminergic neurons of the brain and finally discusses the current status of this technology in the treatment of PD. From the review, it becomes evident that with the assistance of nanovesicle technology, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD pharmaceuticals, phyto-compounds, as well as that of nucleic acids targeting α-synuclein aggregation gained a significant increment. Furthermore, owing to the multiple drug-carrying abilities of nanovesicles, combination therapy targeting multiple pathogenic events of PD has also found success in preclinical studies and will plausibly lead to effective treatment strategies in the near future. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37534999/ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00070",The secondary objectives are: The determination of the recommended phase 2 dose based on the safety profile and preliminary efficacy.

Poster# P98 Phase 2b Randomized dose ranging clinical trial of tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator [SERM], in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): Sensitivity Analyses of discordance between survival and functional outcomes with long term follow-up. Results: ALS patients entered (34 males 26 females) had a mean age of 51 years, and ALS-FRSt of 24 with no significant difference in these parameters among the five dose groups at baseline. Protocol analysis of the difference in survival for the two lower dose cohorts together versus the three upper cohorts together was significant (pv0.04 two-sided safety p value). Cox proportional hazard analyses supported a drug dose effect. Prolongation of 80% survival benefit was above 200 days in the 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg daily tamoxifen treatment cohorts. Survival in the 10 mg weekly-10 mg daily cohorts was identical to that recorded for the ALS patients randomized to placebo in the Dutch ALS Creatine Study. No significant dose-related adverse events occurred throughout the clinical trial. Safety analysis in a single-site phase 2B dose-ranging clinical trial of tamoxifen in ALS patients indicates a survival benefit of tamoxifen treatment with 20–30–40 mg daily compared with 10 mg weekly– 10 mg daily. Sensitivity analyses do not support baseline age, sex, site of onset, duration of ALS, baseline ALSFRSt, baseline VC, or comorbidities as explanatory for this observed survival effect. Slower decrease in VC of the 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg daily tamoxifen treatment cohorts in the second 12–24 month epoch might explain the survival differential but this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: This survival benefit occurred in riluzoletreated ALS patients and was as large or larger than the improved survival in riluzole-treated compared with placebo-treated ALS patients. This observation needs to be replicated in an appropriately statistically powered clinical trial to establish whether tamoxifen should be considered as an adjuvant therapy with riluzole in the treatment of ALS. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17434470510045032 [URL has expired] http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=266","Secondary Outcome Measures: Vital capacity, raw liters and percent predicted, compared with baseline measured at 3 month intervals.

Results: CRE participants experienced higher rates of drug-related AEs (82% vs. 43% T40, 47% T80) and EDD (50% vs. 24% T40, 29% T80). T80 participants experienced slower adjusted mean decline in ALSFRS-R in points/month (-0.80 vs. -0.84 T40, -0.85 CRE) and quantitative muscle strength but not in SVC and higher rates of mortality. Conclusions: Efficacy of T80 ranked numerically superior to CRE and T40 with respect to ALSFRS-R decline. Following the selection paradigm, T80 would be chosen to test against placebo. The approach was not designed to distinguish among treatments that are nearly equally effective or ineffective. If treatments are equivalent, then under the paradigm, it does not matter which treatment is selected. Newer approaches for increasing trial efficiency, including an adaptive platform trial design, may mitigate limitations of the selection design. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608711 (Full Text Available at Source URL) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21678421.2019.1672750?journalCode=iafd20; Decmeber 07, 2013 Presented at the 24th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-8, 2013, Milan, Italy Session Type: POSTER SESSION B Session Title: THEME 5 IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS AND DISEASE PROGRESSION Abstract No.: P115 ATASSI N, MACKLIN E, JACKSON K, BERKLEY J, SIMPSON E, YU H, WALKER J, SIMMONS Z, DAVID W, BARKHAUS P, SIMIONESCU L , DIMACHKIE M , PESTRONK A, SALAMEH J,WEISS M, BRAVVER EK, BROOKS BR, SCHOENFELD D, SHEFNER JM, CUDKOWICZ M PHASE 2 SELECTION TRIAL OF HIGHDOSAGE CREATINE (CRE) AND TWO DOSAGES OF TAMOXIFEN (TAM) IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) Results: Sixty eligible subjects were randomized. Tolerability: the overall rate of drug discontinuation was higher in the CRE 30g group (64%) compared to the TAM 40 mg (43%) and TAM 80 mg (41%) (p = 0.047). Safety: a total of 16 serious adverse events (SAE) occurred during the study (CRE 30 g: 23%, TAM 40 mg: 14%, and TAM 80 mg 29%) and none was considered to be related to study treatments. Nine participants died (CRE 30 g: 14%, TAM 40mg: 10%, and TAM 80 mg: 24%). The CRE group had a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events and two subjects had elevated serum creatinine levels. Efficacy: the rate of decline of ALSFRS-R was numerically slower in the tamoxifen 80 mg group (CRE 30g: - 0.9, TAM 40 mg: - 1.0, TAM 80 mg: - 0.7 point/month) and the rate of decline of VC was numerically slower in the Tamoxifen 40 mg group (CRE 30 g: - 3.4, TAM 40 mg: - 2.9, TAM 80 mg: - 3.3 point/month). The differences in ALSFRS-R and VC rates of decline were not statistically signifi cant. Muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities measured by HHD declined at a slower rate in the tamoxifen 80 mg group followed by tamoxifen 40 mg and creatine 30 g groups (p=0.002). Conclusions: Tamoxifen 40 and 80 mg dosages are well tolerated in ALS and treatment with tamoxifen showed a slower decline in muscle strength in a dose-dependent fashion. A future trial is needed to test the efficacy of tamoxifen 80 mg against placebo in people with ALS.

The primary outcome measure is the treatment response defined as a minimum of 20% improvement in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) slope during the randomized treatment period (18 months) compared to the lead-in period (3 months). Randomization will be stratified by country. Primary analysis will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle through an unadjusted logistic regression model. Patient recruitment commenced on February 22, 2019, and was closed on December 23, 2021. The database will be locked in September 2023. Discussion: This paper provides a comprehensive description of the statistical analysis plan in order to ensure the reproducibility of the analysis and avoid selective reporting of outcomes and data-driven analysis. Sensitivity analyses have been included in the protocol to assess the impact of intercurrent events related to the coronavirus disease 2019. By focusing on clinically meaningful and robust outcomes, this trial aims to determine whether TUDCA can be effective in slowing the disease progression in patients with ALS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38053196/","Secondary Outcome Measures : Survival time [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Survival time measured by death or respiratory insufficiency ALS disease functional rating scale - revised version (ALSFRS-R) [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Difference in change from baseline in ALSFRS-R. Each task of the scale is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score ranging from 0 = worst to 48 = best. ALS Assessment Questionnaire-40 (ALSAQ-40) [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Difference in change from baseline in ALSAQ-40. The instrument contains 40 statements that measure five dimensions of health state: Physical Mobility (10 statements), Activities of Daily Living and Independence (10 statements), Eating and Drinking (5 statements), Communication (5 statements), Emotional Functioning (10 statements). The patient must indicate how often (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, or Always) the statement have been true. Dimension scores are coded on a likert scale, ranging from 0 (best health as assessed by the scale) to 100 (worse health as assessed by the measure). Forced Vital Capacity [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Difference in change from baseline in Forced Vital Capacity EuroQol 5-Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) scale [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Difference in change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L scale. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: 1.no problems, 2.slight problems, 3.moderate problems, 4.severe problems, 5.extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the patient health state. Numbers 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score. Medical Research Council (MRC) scale [ Time Frame: 18 months ] Difference in change from baseline in muscle force assessed by the MRC scale. The scale rates muscle strength of 6 muscles (3 at the upper and 3 at the lower limbs), bilaterally. Each muscle is graded from 0 = no movement, to 5 = normal strength, giving a total sum-score that ranges from 0 (total paralysis) to 60 (normal strength).

Perrin Tegoprubart (AT-1501) is safe and well tolerated and reduces inflammation in patients with ALS Results: Seventy participants were screened, and fifty-four were enrolled in the study. Forty-nine completed the study (90.7%) receiving all six infusions of tegoprubart and completing their final follow up visit. The most common TEAEs overall ( > 10%) were fatigue (25.9%), falls (22.2%), headaches (20.4%), and muscle spasms (11.1%). Mean tegoprubart plasma concentrations increased proportionally with increasing dose with a half-life of approximately 24 days. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers were low and circulating levels of tegoprubart were as predicted for all cohorts. Tegopurbart demonstrated dose dependent target engagement as evidenced by a reduction in circulating levels of CD40L and CXCL13. While the study was not designed to detect clinical efficacy, target engagement was associated with a trend suggesting slowing in loss of function by change from baseline in ALSFRS-R. Tegoprubart also reduced multiple pro-inflammatory biomarkers in circulation in a dose dependent fashion, including TNFa, En-raged, IL-16, IL-18, CXCL9 and CXCL10 among others. The target engagement and inflammatory biomarkers showed increasing levels of reduction from the 1mg/ kg dose cohort to the 2mg/kg dose cohort and then plateaued at the 4mg/kg cohort. The changes were seen after the first dose and persisted throughout the treatment period. Conclusions: Tegoprubart was safe and well tolerated in adults with ALS demonstrating dose dependent functional activity to engage target and reduce pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines associated with ALS. These results warrant further clinical studies with sufficient power and duration to assess clinical outcomes as a potential treatment for adults with ALS.

(“Eledon”) (Nasdaq: ELDN), a patient-focused clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of innovative and impactful treatments for organ and cell transplantation, autoimmune conditions, and neurodegenerative disease, today announced topline results from a Phase 2a clinical trial of tegoprubart (formerly AT-1501) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Tegoprubart is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits CD40 Ligand (CD40L), a membrane protein linked to increased peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation in ALS. The 12-week trial included 54 patients with ALS at 13 treatment sites in the United States and Canada. The primary objectives of the study were to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of tegoprubart in four sequential, ascending dose cohorts (1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg). Secondary outcome measures included pharmacokinetic assessment of multiple intravenous doses of tegoprubart on target engagement and on pro-inflammatory biomarkers associated with ALS. Each subject served as their own control, with changes being compared to baseline. Tegoprubart successfully met the primary endpoints of safety and tolerability. Adverse events were equally distributed across dose levels. Tegoprubart was well-tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were present in less than 5 percent of samples. All ADAs were of low titer and did not impact tegoprubart drug levels. Tegoprubart target engagement was demonstrated at the 4 and 8 mg / kg dosing levels using CD40L and CXCL13 biomarkers related to T cell and B cell function, respectively. A pro-inflammatory ALS signature was identified, consisting of 32 different inflammatory biomarkers in the tested population, including TNF-a, MCP1, EN-RAGE, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and IL-6. IL-1 was not significantly detected in the study patient population. Dose dependent, significant reductions were observed in up to 23 of these biomarkers, including TNF-a, MCP1, EN-RAGE, and CRP. Other pro-inflammatory biomarkers significantly reduced included biomarkers also associated with IgA nephropathy and kidney transplant rejection, such as IgA, IgE, IgM, C3, CXCL9, and CXCL10. While the study was neither primarily designed nor powered to assess the effect of tegoprubart on ALS Functional Rating Scale (“ALSFRS”), both target engagement and level of pro-inflammatory biomarker reduction were associated with a trend in the slowing of disease progression as measured by ALSFRS slope when compared to a cohort from the ALS PRO-ACT database2. “Neuroinflammation is a driving force in the pathogenesis and progression of ALS. The ability to suppress inflammatory responses may translate into clinical benefit,” said Stanley H. Appel, MD, Co-Director of the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute and Chair of the Stanley H. Appel Department of Neurology at Houston Methodist. “These results reinforce the exciting potential of tegoprubart as a promising therapy for patients with ALS.” “These positive Phase 2a topline trial results demonstrated target engagement and a reduction in key inflammatory biomarkers in patients living with ALS,” said Merit Cudkowicz, MD, Chief of the Neurology Department at Massachusetts General Hospital; Director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS; and Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. “A key goal for Phase 2 trials is confirming that a drug hits the intended targets. These encouraging data support advancing tegoprubart into larger clinical ALS studies... ...Our new data are helping elucidate the role of inflammation in ALS and tegoprubart...We look forward to presenting and reporting additional data from this and from our other clinical trials later this year. http://ir.novustherapeutics.com//news-releases/news-release-details/eledon-announces-positive-topline-results-phase-2a-trial","Exploratory endpoints include changes in ALSFRS-R and respiratory function from baseline, evaluation of biomarkers of target engagement, and changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilament light chain in circulation from baseline Secondary outcome measures included pharmacokinetic assessment of multiple intravenous doses of tegoprubart on target engagement and on pro-inflammatory biomarkers associated with ALS. Secondary endpoints assessed the pharmacokinetics of tegoprubart as well as antidrug antibody responses.

Bornstein, Joachim Theilhaber. Tegoprubart Reduced Inflammation in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): Potential Implications for Its Use in the Prevention of Rejection in Kidney Transplant RESULTS Tegoprubart appeared safe and well tolerated at the doses administered. Target engagement was achieved in a dose dependent fashion. In this population of ALS patients, tegoprubart reduced inflammatory biomarkers with the same dose dependent pattern as target engagement. Importantly for KT, tegoprubart reduced CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines reported to be associated with acute allograft rejection. CONCLUSION In a study of patients with ALS, tegoprubart at doses of 4mg/kg and 8mg/kg IV every 2 weeks demonstrated target engagement with an associated reduction in inflammation. Among the inflammatory biomarkers reduced were CXCL9 and CXCL10, positive signals for tegoprubart's ongoing program in KT.

The mean AT-1501 t1/2 in healthy volunteers was 18 to 26 days. AT1501 had a safety profile comparable to placebo and was well tolerated in healthy subjects and subjects with ALS. 54% of subjects treated with AT-1501 had at least 1 TEAE and 62% of subjects treated with placebo had at least 1 TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs overall were headache, somnolence, and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no meaningful laboratory abnormalities, vital sign assessments, ECG assessments, or physical examination findings. Positive ADA responses to AT-1501 were observed in 6 of 30 subjects in the study. There was no dose dependence with respect to the incidence of positive ADA titers. ADA did not appear to affect AT-1501 plasma PK profiles or parameters suggesting they were not neutralizing. 8 mg/kg AT-1501 successfully blocked an immune response to KLH challenge in 2 of the 3 subjects tested.

Results: Dose proportionality was achieved over the AT-1501 dose range of 0.5 to 8 mg/kg for Cmax and AUC0-t. AT-1501 plasma concentrations decreased over time at all dose levels and were measurable out to 42 days post dose. The mean AT-1501 t1/2 in healthy volunteers was 18 to 26 days. The PK parameters in ALS were consistent with those from healthy volunteers at the 1 mg/kg dose level.AT-1501 had a safety profile comparable to placebo and was well tolerated in healthy subjects and subjects with ALS. 54% of subjects treated with AT-1501 had at least 1 TEAE and 62% of subjects treated with placebo had at least 1 TEAE. TEAEs ranged from 33% to 66.7% across groups and did not appear to be dose proportional. No subject had a Grade 2 or higher TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs overall were headache, somnolence, and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no meaningful laboratory abnormalities, vital sign assessments, ECG assessments, or physical examination findings.Positive ADA responses to AT-1501 were observed in 6 of 30 subjects in the study.

Thalidomide had several side-effects in our ALS patients. There was no significant shift in cytokine profile after treatment compared to baseline. Conclusion: In conclusion, treatment of ALS with the TNF-alpha inhibitor, thalidomide, does not appear to effectively modulate disease progression and can cause adverse effects. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19922130?dopt=Abstract http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908298465; November 03, 2008 Presented at 19th International Symposium on ALS/MND, November 3-5 2008, Birmingham, UK Abstract# P05 Stommel E, Cohen J, Fadul C, Cogbill C, Graber D, Kingman L, Mackenzie T, Harris B A Phase II Clinical Trial Using Thalidomide for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is not Effective Results: Twenty-three patients enrolled in the trial and were evaluated every 3 months for up to 9 months and in 2 cases longer. The major side effects of thalidomide included deepvein thrombosis and peripheral neuropathy. Minor side effects included constipation, rash, sedation, bradycardia and elevated liver functions. Despite promising evidence from in vitro and in animal model studies, the trial was terminated early when we found that thalidomide had no statistically significant benefit on functional assessment scoring, survival, or pulmonary function. Serum cytokine analysis and postmortem pathology are reported and discussed. Discussion: The lack of efficacy may relate to any number of issues including the lack of appropriate receptor and intracellular targeting with thalidomide, a lack of efficacy related to an insufficient dosing, and the late initiation of therapy because of the inherent late diagnosis of the disease. Further clinical trials targeting TNF-a might be warranted, but this small trial does not provide support that reducing TNF-a levels improves ALS disease progression. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1285 (Page 2 and 3 of 8)","Secondary Outcome Measures To evaluate -Toxicity -Quality of life -Cytokine profile -PFT's -Sleep questionnaire -Survival of thalidomide in the treatment of ALS.[ Time Frame: survival and progression free suvival will be assessed from the date of initial therapy on study to date od death.

Adverse Events Safety and Tolerability,0,"October 08, 2007 Presented at the XII Pan American Congress of Neurology, Santo Domingo A pilot, randomized clinical trial of thalidomide in patients with ALS. Results: Within 12 weeks of THL treatment, nine THL patients (50%) developed bradycardia defined as a heart rate below 60 beats per minute (bpm) and ranged from 46 to 59 bpm. Mean heart rate dropped by 17 bpm with THL treatment. Severe symptomatic bradycardia of 30 bpm occurred in one patient. A further patient died from sudden unexpected death. The study was terminated prematurely for safety concerns. The secondary outcome variables showed similar results for both groups. Conclusion: Bradycardia was the most common adverse event of THL treatment in ALS. THL-related bradycardia does not appear to be ALS-specific. It is conceivable, however, that the unexpected frequency and severity of THL-induced bradycardia may be related to subclinical involvement of the autonomic nervous system in ALS.

Safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of a skeletal muscle activator in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: Sixty-three patients completed all three dosing periods. CK-2017357 was well tolerated, with dizziness and general fatigue being the most frequent adverse events. Both patients and investigators perceived a dose-dependent benefit of CK-2017357 as measured by global impression of change. Maximum voluntary ventilation and submaximal handgrip endurance also improved. Only small changes were seen in maximal strength. Conclusions: In conclusion, single doses of 250 mg and 500 mg of CK-2017357 were safe and well tolerated by patients with ALS. Measures of endurance appear to be improved in a dose-related fashion, and both patients and investigators perceived a global benefit. Further study of this agent is warranted. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22591195 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17482968.2012.684214; April 15, 2011 Presented at the 63rd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 9-16, 2011, Honolulu, HI Abstract no: PL02.002 Jeremy Shefner,Merit Cudkowicz, Nicholas Maragakis, Robert Miller, Andrew Wolff, Jacqueline Lee, Khalil Saikali, Michael Chen, Deborah Bradshaw, Todd Levine, Jonathan Katz,, Terry Heiman-Patterson, Edward Kasarskis, Jeffrey Rosenfeld, Zachary Simmons, Kevin Boylan, Richard Bedlack, Alan Pestronk, Kimberly Goslin, Nazem Atassi, Carlayne Jackson, Mary Lou Watson, Katie Shaver, Elizabeth Simpson A Phase 2, Single Dose Study of CK-2017357, a Skeletal Muscle Troponin Activator in Patients with ALS Results: The drug was well tolerated; the main treatment emergent adverse event was dizziness. Global impression of change assessed by both investigators and patients showed perceived improvement in more patients on active treatment than placebo (p<0.05). Increases in an ALS Functional Assessment, vital capacity, and grip strength were also noted, as were trends to increase maximal isometric strength. Although there was no obvious dose dependency, there were clear relationships between increases in several of the above measures and plasma drug levels. Conclusions: CK-2017357 appears well tolerated and safe at single doses of 250 and 500 mg. Both doses improved global assessments; tests of vital capacity and motor function also favored active treatment over placebo. These results suggest a potential role for direct skeletal muscle activators in the treatment of ALS, and warrant further study. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN11L_PL02.002","The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the PK/PD relationship, safety and tolerability, and effects on patient- and investigator-determined global functional assessment of CK-357 in ALS patients.

At the highest plasma concentration range (>12 mcg/mL), the mean percent increase in peak force was 17.0% at 10 Hz (p<0.0007). By dose, the largest mean percent increase in peak force, 20.7% at 10 Hz, was observed 5 hours after dosing with 1000 mg (p=0.02). CK-357 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported. No clinically important changes in other safety assessments, including vital signs, ECGs, and clinical labs, were observed. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the pre-clinical mechanism of action of CK-357 translates in healthy subjects into an increase in skeletal muscle force production at low- to mid-range nerve stimulation frequencies and supports further evaluation of CK-357 in neuromuscular and other diseases associated with muscle weakness or fatigue. http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=2554&cKey=228d0d6a-9eec-4005-b60c-0b5a1db10d9a&sKey=0df0221e-d47c-4906-92c6-6077019d1ea4",Secondary objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of CK-2017357.,CY 4011 TrialTroveID-108007,"Primary objective: To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CK-2017357 administered orally.",,,108007,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,I,,0,9,0,0,0,1,10,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Change From CY 4031 Baseline in ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) Total Score at Week 24 [ Time Frame: baseline and 24 weeks ] The ALSFRS-R is used to measure the progression and severity of disability in patients with ALS. The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in the following 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal).

Change From CY 4031 Baseline in ALSFRS-R Total Score at Week 48 [ Time Frame: baseline and 48 weeks ] The ALSFRS-R is used to measure the progression and severity of disability in patients with ALS. The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in the following 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal). The total score ranges from 0 to 48, with higher scores reflecting more normal function and lower scores reflecting more impaired function. Comparing postbaseline to baseline assessments, a negative value indicates a worsening in function. • Time to first use of assisted ventilation or death • Time to the first occurrence of respiratory insufficiency (defined as tracheostomy or the use of non-invasive ventilation for > or = 22 hours per day for > or = 10 consecutive days) or death • Time to death • Decline in percent predicted SVC from baseline • Decline in ALSFRS-R score from baseline • Slope of the change from baseline in percent predicted SVC • Slope of the change from baseline in ALSFRS-R Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point The time to event endpoints will be assessed from the start of CY 4031 and from the start of CY 4033 to the end of CY 4033.

Malik, L. Meng, S. Rudnicki, J. Wei, A. Wolff and J. Shefner Cytokinetics, Incorporated; Barrow Neurological Institute, University of Arizona, and Creighton University Plasma neurofilament analysis in VITALITY-ALS: analysis at baseline, longitudinal, and by rate of disease progression Results: Nf measurements were available from 101 placebo- and 161 tirasemtiv-treated pALS. There were no significant differences in Nf between placebo vs tirasemtiv groups at any timepoint; therefore, further analysis grouped all sam- ples. At baseline, Nf did not differ by El Escorial category, dis- ease duration, or site of onset. While mean Nf values did not differ meaningfully among tertiles, baseline NfL correlated with the psRDP (r ¼ 0.5, p < 0.001) driven primarily by FP (r ¼ 0.4, p < 0.001). Baseline NfL showed fair negative correl- ation with 12-month isRDP (r¼–0.5, p < 0.001) and isRDP sig- nificantly (p < 0.001) increased with each tertile of baseline NfL. pNfH showed similar, but less robust, patterns. Over 48 weeks, pNfH levels continuously decreased, reaching statis- tical significance at Week 16 (p ¼ 0.0003) and declined with each 8-week interval (p < 0.0001 from Week 24 onward), whereas NfL did not change meaningfully over time. Conclusions: In this large longitudinal study, baseline NfL cor- related with psRDP, driven by FP, and isRDP. No meaningful patterns of change in NfL over time were observed. The find- ings suggest NfL may have utility in identifying pALS with higher risk of faster disease progression, although the results should be interpreted with caution given the degree of cor- relation was somewhat modest. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260202?needAccess=true; April 1, 2021 Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2021 Apr 1;1-9.

The three most common reasons NIV was prescribed were decline in vital capacity, respiratory symptoms, and sleep-related symptoms. During the trial, 179/565 (31.7%) patients had a decline of SVC below 50%; of these patients, 122/179 (68.2%) were prescribed NIV. Reasons for prescribing NIV were different for patients from North America compared with Europe. Conclusions: Despite allowing for NIV initiation at any point following randomization in VITALITY-ALS, only slightly more than two out of three patients whose SVC fell below 50% were prescribed NIV; this was similar in Europe and in North America. Underutilization of NIV could influence survival outcomes in patients with ALS including those involved in clinical trials. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33792451/ Full text available at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2021.1904993; June 19, 2020 ClinicalTrials.gov Results: Results First Posted: June 19, 2020 Last Update Posted: June 19, 2020 Recruitment Details: Patients with familial or sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were enrolled at 79 sites in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. The first patient was screened on 03 September 2015 and the last subject completed on 27 September 2017. Pre-Assignment Details: All enrolled patients began open-label tirasemtiv (250 mg) in a 2-week lead-in phase. Completed patients were randomized (3:2:2:2) to placebo or tirasemtiv (250, 375, or 500 mg) for 48 weeks of double-blind treatment. After which, patients on tirasemtiv were re-randomized (1:1) to placebo or tirasemtiv (current dose) for a 4-week withdrawal phase.

Results: Of 744 participants, 565 tolerated open-label tirasemtiv and received randomized treatment. By 24 weeks, 23 (12.2%) placebo-treated participants discontinued study treatment vs. 129 (34.2%) randomized to tirasemtiv. SVC declined by 14.4% (95% CI: -16.8, -11.9) in the placebo group and 13.4% (95% CI: -15.3, -11.6) in the tirasemtiv group (p?=?0.56). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences. However, participants who tolerated tirasemtiv at their randomized dose showed a numeric trend toward a dose-related slowing of decline in SVC (p?=?0.11). Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and insomnia occurred more frequently on tirasemtiv. Serious adverse events were similar across groups. Conclusions: Tirasemtiv did not alter the decline of SVC or significantly impact secondary outcome measures. Poor tolerability of tirasemtiv may have contributed to this result. However, participants tolerating their intended dose exhibited a trend toward treatment benefit on SVC, suggesting the underlying mechanism of action may still hold promise, as is being tested with a different fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (NCT03160898). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081694 Full Text available at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2019.1612922","Secondary objectives - Evaluation of alternative methods to assess the effect of tirasemtiv versus placebo on percent predicted SVC in patients with ALS - Assessment of the effect of tirasemtiv versus placebo on other clinical measures related to the progressive decline in respiratory function in patients with ALS - Assessment of the effect of tirasemtiv versus placebo on measures of skeletal muscle function in patients with ALS Secondary end point(s): Time to the first occurrence of a decline from baseline in percent predicted SVC >/= 10 percentage points or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death during the first 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment Change from baseline to 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment in the following measures: a.

Results: The primary endpoint showed no treatment effect (tirasemtiv: -2.98?+ or -?0.28, placebo: -2.40?+ or -0.25, p?=?0.114); however, SVC and muscle strength declined significantly more slowly on tirasemtiv (95% CI p?=?0.0006, p?=?0.0158, respectively). Dropouts and serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the tirasemtiv group. Conclusion: This was a negative study with respect to the primary endpoint; however, the effects on SVC and muscle strength suggest a potentially important effect of tirasemtiv warranting further evaluation over a longer period in ALS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982815 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/21678421.2016.1148169?journalCode=iafd20; December 6, 2014 Presented at the 25th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 5-7, 2014, Brussels, Belgium Session type: Poster Session B Theme: 11 - Therapeutic Strategies Poster Number P283 Shefner J, Andrews J, Meng L, Bian A, Wolff A, Study Group Benefit ALS Relationships Between Riluzole and Tirasemtiv Levels on Outcomes in the BENEFIT-ALS Trial Results: Although riluzole levels in the Tirasemtiv group were approximately 40% higher than in the placebo group, there was no indication that this difference was related to frequency or intensity of adverse events. The relationship between treatment emergent adverse events and Tirasemtiv levels were evaluated. Efficacy measures were evaluated both as a function of maximum tolerated Tirasemtiv dose and serum Tirasemtiv concentration. For SVC, there was a positive relationship between serum concentration and SVC benefit. Initial modelling suggests that the relationships between Tirasemtiv concentration and other efficacy measures were not linear. With respect to efficacy, riluzole levels had no impact on any measure. Discussion and conclusion: In the BENEFIT-ALS trial, riluzole seemed to not have an impact either on Tirasemtiv efficacy or tolerability, suggesting that the strategy of dose lowering in patients on Tirasemtiv had the intended effect. Adverse events were evaluated with respect to Tirasemtiv levels; the relationship of Tirasemtiv to measures of efficacy was complex. Multiple models relating Tirasemtiv concentration to efficacy measures will be explored and presented. These results will help inform further development of this agent. http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/21678421.2014.960188; December 5, 2014 Presented at the 25th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 5-7, 2014, Brussels, Belgium Session type: Platform Communications Session title: ""SESSION 3B TRIALS AND TRIAL DESIGN "" Abstract ID: C16 ANDREWS J , LEE J , MENG L , BIAN A , WOLFF A , SHEFNER J THE EFFECTS OF TIRASEMTIV ON MEASURES OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) Results: During 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, SVC declined more slowly on Tirasemtiv versus placebo (p =0.0006). There was no difference in the rate of decline in MVV (p=0.880) or SNIP (p=0.211). Pulmonary measures were reasonably correlated at baseline (SVC/SNIP r =0.338; SVC/MVV r= 0.321; MVV/SNIP r= 0.426 (p = 0.0001 for all)) but changes from baseline generally were poorly correlated. Tirasemtiv reduced the decline in SVC versus placebo regardless of age, gender, riluzole use, or BMI. Subgroups with the largest and most signifi cant differences in SVC on Tirasemtiv versus placebo (change from baseline to mean SVC after 8 and 12 weeks of doubleblind treatment) were: female (6.84%, p=0.012); non-riluzole users (6.55%, p= 0.0005); with a baseline SVC > or = median at baseline (6.02%, p< 0.0001). SVC, SNIP and MVV were not affected by weight change. Discussion and conclusion: Treatment with Tirasemtiv significantly reduced decline of SVC after 12 weeks of treatment. Subgroup analyses revealed that effect of Tirasemtiv on SVC was not a function of any specifi c subgroup. Vital capacity is a clinically meaningful measure that is used to determine major clinical decisions in the treatment of ALS and is also used to aid prognosis. The effect of Tirasemtiv on SVC should have meaningful and positive effect on patients with ALS, if confirmed in future longer duration studies.

Tirasemtiv approximately doubled the serum concentration of riluzole. Trends were noted for improvement in ALSFRS-R, Maximum Minute Ventilation, and Nasal Inspiratory Pressure. Conclusions: In conclusion, tirasemtiv is well tolerated and can be given safely with a reduced dose of riluzole.

Results: Plasma levels of CK-357 achieved steady state by Day 8; 4 h after dosing on Day 8, the levels were approximately 70% higher than those observed at 4 h after the first dose on Day 1. CK-357 Cmax increased proportionally by dose with no apparent effect of riluzole on CK-357 Cmax. At 125 mg, 250 mg, and 375 mg daily, Cmax was 4.1 mcg/ml, 7.4 mcg/ml, and 12.7 mcg/ml, respectively, for subjects who were not on riluzole, and 6.0 mcg/ml, 8.4 mcg/ml, and 13.5 mcg/ml for those subjects who were on riluzole. In contrast, CK-357 approximately doubled riluzole levels similarly across all dose groups. Adverse event frequencies were not altered by the presence of riluzole at any dose of CK-357. Conclusions: CK-357 had predictable linear kinetics at the repeated doses used in the current study, reaching steady state within 1 week. CK- 357 plasma levels were not affected by the presence of riluzole. Riluzole levels were increased by CK-357, with plasma levels increasing approximately two-fold across all dose levels of CK-357. However, no adverse events were reported during this study, and this was attributable to higher riluzole levels, with the daily riluzole dose reduced to 50 mg daily. These results suggest that CK-357 and riluzole may be given safely in combination. http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/17482968.2012.721231B (Page# 27); April 25, 2012 Presented at the 64th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 21-28, 2012, New Orleans, LA Abstract No: S25.005 Jeremy Shefner, Richard Barohn, Kevin Boylan, Deborah Bradshaw, Benjamin Brooks, Terry Heiman-Patterson, Jonathan Katz, Nicholas Maragakis, Hiroshi Mitsumoto, Alan Pestronk,Zachary Simmons, Andrew Wolff, Jacqueline Lee, Jean Masonek, Drew Jones , Lisa Meng, Jesse Cedarbaum, A Study To Evaluate Safety, and Tolerability of Repeated Doses of CK-2017357 (CK-357) in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Results: For the first 24 patients, average age was 55 (range: 28-75) years; 50% were males.

Ladha MD Tocilizumab is safe and tolerable and reduces C-reactive protein concentrations in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients Results: Baseline characteristics, safety, and tolerability were similar between treatment groups. One serious adverse event was reported in the placebo group; no deaths occurred. Mean plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased by 88% in the tocilizumab group and increased by 4% in the placebo group (-3.0-fold relative change, P<0.001). CSF CRP reduction (-1.8-fold relative change, P=0.01) was associated with IL6R C allele count. No differences in PBMC gene expression or clinical measures were observed between groups. Discussion: Tocilizumab treatment was safe and well tolerated. PBMC gene expression profile was inadequate as a predictive or pharmacodynamic biomarker. Treatment reduced CRP levels in plasma and CSF, with CSF effects potentially dependent on IL6R Asp358 Ala genotype. IL-6 trans-signaling may mediate a distinct central nervous system response in individuals inheriting the IL6R C allele. These results warrant further study in ALS patients where IL6R genotype and CRP levels may be useful enrichment biomarkers.

Mandrioli; Inflammatory and neurodegenerative biomarkers in SOD1-related ALS after treatment with Tofersen Results: Ten patients (M/F: 5/5; mean age at onset: 50.01) were treated with Tofersen 100mg intrathecally every 28 days. Patients treated with Tofersen harbored A5V, G11E, E41G, D91A, A96T, E134del, L145F and I150T mutations, rep- resenting both slow and fast forms of the disease. Median treatment duration was 11 months (IQR: 6–14). Mean pro- gression rate at diagnosis was 0.57 (SD 0.669, whereas ALSFRS-R monthly decline at last observation in Tofersen- treated ALS patients was 0.24 (SD: 0.21). There was a trend towards a decrease in NfL both in CSf and serum (mean CSF- NfL: 28%, range þ34% to 74%, p ¼ 0.17 at month 9; mean sNfL: 26%, range þ4 to 61%, p ¼ 0.46 at month 9), although not statistically significant. On the contrary, there was a tendency towards an increase in biomarkers of neuro- inflammation, especially CSF-serpinA1, after six and nine months (p ¼ 0.01 and p ¼ 0.02). Conclusions: In persons with SOD1 ALS, we found an expected, although not significant, trend towards a reduction of neurofila- ments in Tofersen treated patients as already reported (3). Interestingly, we also observed a general increase of biomarkers of neuroinflammation, mainly after 6 months of treatment, espe- cially CSF serpinA1, which could be related to an immune response evoked by ASOs treatment.

Andrews, M.D., Suma Babu, M.B., B.S., M.P.H., et al., for the VALOR and OLE Working Group Trial of Antisense Oligonucleotide Tofersen for SOD1 ALS Results:A total of 72 participants received tofersen (39 predicted to have faster progression), and 36 received placebo (21 predicted to have faster progression). Tofersen led to greater reductions in concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma than placebo. In the faster-progression subgroup (primary analysis), the change to week 28 in the ALSFRS-R score was −6.98 with tofersen and −8.14 with placebo (difference, 1.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −3.2 to 5.5; P=0.97). Results for secondary clinical end points did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 95 participants (88%) entered the open-label extension. At 52 weeks, the change in the ALSFRS-R score was −6.0 in the early-start cohort and −9.5 in the delayed-start cohort (difference, 3.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.7); non–multiplicity-adjusted differences favoring early-start tofersen were seen for other end points. Lumbar puncture–related adverse events were common. Neurologic serious adverse events occurred in 7% of tofersen recipients. CONCLUSIONS In persons with SOD1 ALS, tofersen reduced concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma over 28 weeks but did not improve clinical end points and was associated with adverse events. The potential effects of earlier as compared with delayed initiation of tofersen are being further evaluated in the extension phase. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2204705 https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2204705?articleTools=true https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2204705/suppl_file/nejmoa2204705_research-summary.pdf https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2204705/suppl_file/nejmoa2204705_protocol.pdf https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2204705/suppl_file/nejmoa2204705_appendix.pdf; September 21, 2022 [Press release] The New England Journal of Medicine Publishes Pivotal Tofersen Data that Show Benefits in Rare, Genetic Form of ALS Publication includes the Phase 3 VALOR SOD1-ALS trial and its open-label-extension study, underscoring the importance of these longer-term data 12-month data show earlier initiation of tofersen slowed decline across critical measures of function and strength in people diagnosed with SOD1-ALS Results offer important learnings regarding the biology of SOD1-ALS and design of ALS clinical trials CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) has published detailed results from the Phase 3 VALOR study and the combined analysis of VALOR and its open label extension (OLE) study evaluating tofersen for the treatment of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There is currently no treatment targeted for SOD1-ALS. “I see three key take home points from these data. First, tofersen clearly leads to lowering of SOD1 protein, as would be expected. Second there is substantial lowering of neurofilament levels, which I interpret as potentially slowing the underlying disease process. And third, there is a meaningful clinical benefit when looking at the later time points in the open label extension,” said Timothy Miller, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator of VALOR and ALS Center co-Director at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. “We are grateful to the dedication from participants, their families, and the sites for taking part in this important study.” Data from the combined analysis were previously presented at the European Network to Cure ALS (ENCALS) annual meeting and included within Biogen’s New Drug Application for tofersen that was recently accepted for priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In total, 108 participants were randomized in VALOR (n=72 to tofersen 100 mg and n=36 to placebo). Of these participants, 95 enrolled in the ongoing OLE. At the time of the analysis all participants had an opportunity for at least 12 months of follow-up, with a median exposure to tofersen of approximately 20 months (range: 1 – 34 months). The primary endpoint of VALOR was change from baseline to week 28 in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score. Secondary endpoints included changes in total cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 protein concentration, plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), slow vital capacity and handheld dynamometry in 16 muscles. As previously reported in October 2021, VALOR did not meet the primary endpoint. However, trends of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were observed. The combined VALOR and OLE 12-month data, in which the clinical analyses adjusted for neurofilament levels as a marker of the disease progression rate at baseline, showed sustained reductions in SOD1 protein (a marker of target engagement) and neurofilament (a marker of neurodegeneration) and slowed decline in clinical function, respiratory function, strength, and quality of life with earlier initiation of tofersen. In the 12-month data, the most common adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving tofersen in VALOR and the OLE study were procedural pain, headache, pain in the arms or legs, falls, and back pain. Most AEs in both VALOR and the OLE were mild to moderate in severity.

(Nasdaq: IONS) partner Biogen today announced results from the Phase 3 VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) of tofersen, an investigational antisense medicine being evaluated for people with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The data show that earlier initiation of tofersen, compared to delayed initiation, slowed declines in clinical function, respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life. At the time of the analysis, because the majority of participants survived without permanent ventilation (PV), the median time to death or PV could not be estimated. However, early survival data suggest a lower risk of death or PV with earlier initiation of tofersen. These results are based on new integrated data from the VALOR pivotal study and its OLE study. The results were presented at the European Network to Cure ALS (ENCALS) meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland. An archived version of the presentation will be available on the Investors section of Biogen's website at investors.biogen.com. ""We are very pleased with these new 12-month data, which show that tofersen slowed disease progression and lowered neurofilament levels. Together, these results offer compelling evidence of tofersen's potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to people living with SOD1-ALS,"" said C. Frank Bennett, Ph.D., executive vice president, chief scientific officer and franchise leader for neurological programs at Ionis. Clinical Results As previously reported in October 2021, VALOR, a six-month Phase 3 randomized study, did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 28 in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). However, trends of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were observed. The new 12-month data further build on the results previously observed in the initial readout. The 12-month data compare early initiation of tofersen (at the start of VALOR) to delayed initiation of tofersen (six months later, in the OLE). Over 12 months in the overall study population, results favored earlier start tofersen on measures of: Clinical function as measured by ALSFRS-R (difference of 3.5 points; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4, 6.7) Respiratory function as measured by slow vital capacity (difference of 9.2 percent-predicted; 95% CI: 1.7, 16.6) Muscle strength as measured by the handheld dynamometry megascore (difference of 0.28; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.52) Quality of life as measured by the 5-item amyotrophic lateral sclerosis assessment questionnaire (ALSAQ-5) (difference of 10.3 points; 95% CI: -17.3, -3.2) At the time of the analysis, because the majority of participants survived without permanent ventilation (PV), the median time to death or PV and median time to death, could not be estimated. However, early survival data suggest a lower risk of death or PV (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.36; 95% CI: 0.137, 0.941) and death (HR 0.27; 95% CI: 0.084, 0.890) with earlier initiation of tofersen. Biomarker Results The latest 12-month results show that reductions in total SOD1 protein (a marker of target engagement) and neurofilament (a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration) were sustained over time. Tofersen reduced total CSF SOD1 protein and plasma neurofilament levels in both early- and delayed-start groups as follows: 33 percent and 21 percent reduction in SOD1 protein, the intended target for tofersen, respectively 51 percent and 41 percent reduction in plasma neurofilament, a marker of neuron injury, respectively Safety Results The most common adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving tofersen in VALOR and the OLE study were headache, procedural pain, fall, back pain and pain in extremity. Most AEs in both VALOR and the OLE were mild to moderate in severity. Serious AEs were reported in 36.5 percent of participants who received tofersen in VALOR and/or the OLE and 17.3 percent of participants discontinued treatment due to an AE. Serious neurologic events including myelitis, radiculitis, aseptic meningitis, and papilledema, were reported in 6.7 percent of participants receiving tofersen in VALOR and its OLE. There were 14 deaths reported in tofersen-treated participants in VALOR and the OLE, all of which were determined not to be related to tofersen. About VALOR and the OLE VALOR was a 28-week Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of tofersen 100 mg in 108 adults with ALS associated with a SOD1 mutation. In total, 108 participants were randomized in VALOR (n=72 to tofersen 100 mg and n=36 to placebo). Of these participants, 95 enrolled in the ongoing OLE. At the time of the analysis all participants had an opportunity for at least 12 months of follow-up, with a median exposure to tofersen of approximately 20 months (range: 1 – 34 months). To account for disease heterogeneity, the planned clinical analyses adjusted for neurofilament levels as a marker of the disease progression rate at baseline. Neurofilaments are proteins that increase in blood and cerebrospinal fluid when neurons or their axons are damaged. Neurofilaments have been shown to be a prognostic marker of disease progression and survival in ALS. https://ir.ionispharma.com//news-releases/news-release-details/ionis-partner-biogen-announces-results-phase-3-valor-study-and","The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy of BIIB067 administered to participants with ALS and confirmed SOD1 mutation.

Tofersen reduced total CSF SOD1 protein and plasma neurofilament levels in both early- and delayed-start groups as follows: 33 percent and 21 percent reduction in SOD1 protein, the intended target for tofersen, respectively 51 percent and 41 percent reduction in plasma neurofilament, a marker of neuron injury, respectively Safety Results The most common adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving tofersen in VALOR and the OLE study were headache, procedural pain, fall, back pain and pain in extremity. Most AEs in both VALOR and the OLE were mild to moderate in severity. Serious AEs were reported in 36.5 percent of participants who received tofersen in VALOR and/or the OLE and 17.3 percent of participants discontinued treatment due to an AE. Serious neurologic events including myelitis, radiculitis, aseptic meningitis, and papilledema, were reported in 6.7 percent of participants receiving tofersen in VALOR and its OLE. There were 14 deaths reported in tofersen-treated participants in VALOR and the OLE, all of which were determined not to be related to tofersen. About VALOR and the OLE VALOR was a 28-week Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of tofersen 100 mg in 108 adults with ALS associated with a SOD1 mutation. In total, 108 participants were randomized in VALOR (n=72 to tofersen 100 mg and n=36 to placebo). Of these participants, 95 enrolled in the ongoing OLE. At the time of the analysis all participants had an opportunity for at least 12 months of follow-up, with a median exposure to tofersen of approximately 20 months (range: 1 – 34 months). To account for disease heterogeneity, the planned clinical analyses adjusted for neurofilament levels as a marker of the disease progression rate at baseline. Neurofilaments are proteins that increase in blood and cerebrospinal fluid when neurons or their axons are damaged. Neurofilaments have been shown to be a prognostic marker of disease progression and survival in ALS. https://ir.ionispharma.com//news-releases/news-release-details/ionis-partner-biogen-announces-results-phase-3-valor-study-and; October 17, 2021 [Press release] Ionis' partner Biogen provides update on tofersen Phase 3 VALOR study in SOD1-ALS - In the Phase 3 VALOR study, the primary endpoint as measured by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) did not reach statistical significance; however, signs of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were observed - The totality of evidence from VALOR and its ongoing open-label extension showed that participants who started tofersen earlier experienced better outcomes, further suggesting a positive clinical effect - Given the high unmet medical need, Biogen will expand its ongoing early access program (EAP) to the broader SOD1-ALS population - Topline data being presented today at the American Neurological Association 2021 Annual MeetingCARLSBAD, Calif., Oct. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS) partner Biogen today announced topline results from its placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen (BIIB067), an investigational antisense medicine being evaluated for people with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While tofersen did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 28 in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), trends favoring tofersen were seen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of disease activity and clinical function. In addition, a pre-specified integration of data from VALOR and its ongoing open-label extension study (OLE) reinforced these findings and showed that early tofersen initiation led to less decline across multiple measures including motor function, respiratory function, muscle strength, and quality of life in people with SOD1-ALS. Most adverse events in both VALOR and OLE were mild to moderate in severity, including procedural pain, headache, pain in extremity, fall and back pain. Biogen, which licensed tofersen from Ionis in 2018, also announced today that it is actively engaging with regulators, the medical community, patient advocacy groups and other key stakeholders around the world to determine next steps... The VALOR and Open-Label Extension Studies VALOR was a 28-week Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker effects of tofersen 100 mg in adults with ALS associated with a SOD1 mutation. In total, 108 participants were randomized in VALOR (n = 72 to tofersen 100 mg and n = 36 to placebo). Sixty of these participants met the study's protocol-defined enrichment criteria for rapid disease progression, comprising the primary analysis population (""faster progressing""). Forty-eight participants did not meet these prognostic enrichment criteria (""slower progressing"")... Topline Results In VALOR the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to week 28 in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) total score in the primary analysis (faster-progressing) population did not reach statistical significance as measured by a joint-rank analysis (difference of 1.2; p = 0.97). Trends favoring tofersen were seen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biologic activity and clinical function, including motor function, respiratory function and quality of life. On the first key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in total CSF SOD1 protein, a marker of target engagement, differences were observed between the tofersen and placebo groups of 38% and 26% in the faster- and slower-progressing populations, respectively. On the second key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a potential marker of neuronal degeneration, differences were observed between the tofersen and placebo groups of 67% and 48% in the faster- and slower-progressing populations, respectively. In the faster-progressing population, trends favored tofersen on measures of respiratory function (Slow Vital Capacity (SVC); difference of 7.9 percent-predicted) and muscle strength (Hand-held dynamometer (HHD); difference of 0.02). Similar trends were observed across multiple exploratory patient-reported outcome measures of disease severity, quality of life, and fatigue. Median time to event could not be estimated for survival analyses due to the low number of events over the 28-week period. In addition, with longer-term follow up in the OLE, earlier tofersen initiation consistently led to a reduction in decline in measures of clinical function across the population. The most common adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving tofersen in the VALOR study were procedural pain, headache, pain in extremity, fall and back pain. Most AEs in both VALOR and the OLE were mild to moderate in severity. In VALOR, serious AEs were reported in 18.1% of participants receiving tofersen and 13.9% of those receiving placebo. In the tofersen group, 5.6% of participants discontinued treatment due to an AE. There were no discontinuations due to AEs in the placebo group. Serious neurologic events were reported in 4.8% of patients receiving tofersen in VALOR and its OLE, including 2 cases of myelitis (2.0%). There was one death reported in the tofersen-treated group in VALOR, which was determined not to be related to tofersen... https://ir.ionispharma.com//news-releases/news-release-details/ionis-partner-biogen-provides-update-tofersen-phase-3-valor; July 9, 2020 [Post-hoc analysis] N Engl J Med 2020; 383:109-119.

Ferguson. Phase 1–2 Trial of Antisense Oligonucleotide Tofersen for SOD1 ALS RESULTS A total of 50 participants underwent randomization and were included in the analyses; 48 participants received all five planned doses. Lumbar puncture–related adverse events were observed in most participants. Elevations in CSF white-cell count and protein were reported as adverse events in 4 and 5 participants, respectively, who received tofersen. Among participants who received tofersen, one died from pulmonary embolus on day 137, and one from respiratory failure on day 152; one participant in the placebo group died from respiratory failure on day 52. The difference at day 85 in the change from baseline in the CSF SOD1 concentration between the tofersen groups and the placebo group was 2 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -18 to 27) for the 20-mg dose, -25 percentage points (95% CI, -40 to -5) for the 40-mg dose, -19 percentage points (95% CI, -35 to 2) for the 60-mg dose, and -33 percentage points (95% CI, -47 to -16) for the 100-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS In adults with ALS due to SOD1 mutations, CSF SOD1 concentrations decreased at the highest concentration of tofersen administered intrathecally over a period of 12 weeks. CSF pleocytosis occurred in some participants receiving tofersen. Lumbar puncture–related adverse events were observed in most participants. https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2003715/suppl_file/nejmoa2003715_appendix.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640130/ Full text available at: https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2003715/suppl_file/nejmoa2003715_protocol.pdf https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2003715/suppl_file/nejmoa2003715_appendix.pdf https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2003715?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/163772/; July 08, 2020 The New England Journal of Medicine Publishes Final Results from Phase 1/2 Study of Tofersen for a Genetic Form of ALS ...Final Phase 1/2 study results demonstrated proof-of-concept and proof-of-biology of tofersen... The Phase 1/2 Study Results The Phase 1/2 study of tofersen was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose study that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy endpoints in individuals living with SOD1-ALS. In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study, participants with SOD1-ALS were randomized to receive tofersen (20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg or 100 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective of the MAD portion of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of tofersen. The most commonly reported adverse events in people who received one or more doses of tofersen (n=38) were headache, procedural pain, post-lumbar puncture syndrome and falls. Five tofersen- and two placebo-treated people experienced serious adverse events. One death occurred in the placebo group during the trial due to respiratory failure secondary to ALS and 2 deaths occurred in the tofersen group during a follow up period due to pulmonary embolism and respiratory failure (20 mg and 60 mg group, respectively).... The secondary outcome was the change from baseline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SOD1 protein concentration. Treatment with tofersen 100 mg (n=10) over a 3-month period resulted in a 36 percent reduction of SOD1 concentration compared to 3 percent in the placebo group (n=12). Exploratory measures demonstrated numerical trends towards slowing of clinical decline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) as well as slow vital capacity and muscle strength measured by handheld dynamometer (HHD) compared to placebo. The mean change in ALSFRS-R score from baseline to day 85 was -1.19 in the tofersen 100 mg group compared to 5.63 in the placebo group on a 48-point scale. Across exploratory clinical measures, separation from the placebo group was primarily driven by the fast-progressing subgroup. A Phase 3 study, VALOR, is currently ongoing and will assess the efficacy and safety of tofersen versus placebo in adults with SOD1-ALS. https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/08/2059597/0/en/The-New-England-Journal-of-Medicine-Publishes-Final-Results-from-Phase-1-2-Study-of-Tofersen-for-a-Genetic-Form-of-ALS.html; April 14, 2020 [Interim Results] Neurology Journal, Volume 94, Issue Supplement 15, April 2020 Presented at the 72nd Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting, April 25-May 1, 2020, Toronto, Canada Available online date: April 14, 2020 Abstract No. S35.003 Merit Cudkowicz, Timothy Miller, Pamela Shaw, C.

Results: The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Dose-dependent increases in tofersen concentrations in plasma and CSF were observed and a statistically significant reduction of CSF SOD1 (100 mg vs placebo) was also observed. A slowing of functional decline as measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised scores, slow vital capacity, and muscle strength was observed (100 mg vs placebo), with a greater difference observed between the 100 mg and placebo groups in participants with fast progressing SOD1 mutations. Baseline CSF and plasma phosphorylated neurofilament heavy and neurofilament light were generally highest in faster progressing participants. Treatment with tofersen was associated with a decline in neurofilament over time in contrast to apparent stabilization or increase observed in placebo-treated patients. Conclusions: These data support further investigation of tofersen in people with SOD1-ALS, and highlight the potential role of neurofilament as a biomarker of disease activity and treatment response in ALS. https://index.mirasmart.com/AAN2020/PDFfiles/AAN2020-000657.html; November 8, 2019 [Interim Results] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 20, Issue supplement 1, November 2019 Presented at the 30th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 4-6, 2019, Perth, Australia Online published date: November 8, 2019 Abstract No.: C11 Timothy Miller, Merit Cudkowicz, Pamela J.

Dose-dependent increases in tofersen concentrations in plasma and CSF were observed. A statis- tically significant reduction of CSF SOD1 was observed in the 100 mg cohort (n = 10) versus placebo (n = 12) (p = 0.002) and suggested substantial reduction of CNS tissue SOD1. Lowering of CSF phosphorylated neurofilament heavy and slowing of functional decline as measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised scores, slow vital capacity, and muscle strength were observed in the 100 mg cohort versus placebo. In participants with SOD1 mutations known to be rapidly progressive, a greater difference between the 100 mg and placebo groups was observed across these measures com- pared to those with other mutations. Conclusions: These interim data demon- strate reduction of SOD1 in CSF and strongly support fur- ther investigation of tofersen efficacy in people with SOD1-ALS. Data from the final analysis will be presented.

Secondary Outcome Measures : Part B: CSF Levels of Total SOD1 Protein Concentration Ratio to Baseline [ Time Frame: Day 85 ] Total CSF SOD1 protein ratio to baseline was calculated. Part C: CSF Levels of Total SOD1 Protein Concentration Ratio to Baseline [ Time Frame: Week 28 (Day 197) ] Total CSF SOD1 protein ratio to baseline was calculated and LS Geometric Mean ratio to baseline was reported. Part C: Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) Plasma Concentration Ratio to Baseline [ Time Frame: Baseline, Day 197 (Week 28) ] NfL is a biomarker whose concentration was assessed in plasma. Plasma NfL ratio to baseline was calculated. Part C: Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) at Week 28 [ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 28 (Day 197) ] Vital capacity was measured by means of an SVC test, administered in the upright position. Part C: Change From Baseline in Handheld Dynamometry (HHD) Megascore as Measured by the HHD Device at Week 28 [ Time Frame: Baseline, Week 28 (Day 197) ] Quantitative muscle strength was evaluated using HHD, which tests isometric strength of multiple muscles using standard participant positioning. Sixteen muscle groups were evaluated in both upper and lower extremities. The muscle strength values were normalized to Z scores as (post-baseline measurements - mean)/SD and averaged to provide HHD overall megascore. The overall megascore was created by averaging all eight bilateral measurement Z scores, if no more than 10 (≤ 10) measures are missing. A negative change from baseline indicated decreased muscle strength.

Most AEs were mild and many were typical side-effects of lumbar puncture. There were no serious AEs. Dosedependent plasma exposure (AUC and Cmax) and CSF BIIB067 concentrations were as expected for intrathecally administered ASOs. Discussion and conclusions: The single dose portion of this first-in-human study of BIIB067 showed favorable safety, tolerability and PK profiles, providing rationale for further, ongoing multiple dose studies in SOD1 ALS. Analysis of CSF SOD1 is ongoing.

An antisense oligonucleotide against SOD1 delivered intrathecally for patients with SOD1 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a phase 1, randomised, first-in-man study Findings: Seven of eight (88%) patients in the placebo group versus 20 of 24 (83%) in the ISIS 333611 group had adverse events. The most common events were post-lumbar puncture syndrome (3/8 [38%] vs 8/24 [33%]), back pain (4/8 [50%] vs 4/24 [17%]), and nausea (0/8 [0%] vs 3/24 [13%]). We recorded no dose-limiting toxic effects or any safety or tolerability concerns related to ISIS 333611. No serious adverse events occurred in patients given ISIS 333611. Re-enrolment and re-treatment were also well tolerated. Interpretation: This trial is the first clinical study of intrathecal delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide. ISIS 333611 was well tolerated when administered as an intrathecal infusion. Antisense oligonucleotides delivered to the CNS might be a feasible treatment for neurological disorders. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541756 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970061-9/abstract Full text available: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442213700619; December 6, 2012 Presented at the Joint Meeting of 23rd International Symposium on ALS/MND and 20th Annual Meeting International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations, December 2-7, 2012, Chicago, IL Session Type: SESSION 7B Session Title: ""CLINICAL TRIALS & TRIAL DESIGN"" Abstract ID # C43 MILLER T , PESTRONK A , DAVID W , ROTHSTEIN J , SIMPSON E , ANDRES P , MAHONEY K , ALLRED P , ALEXANDER K , BISHOP K , SCHOENFELD D , MACKLIN E , NORRIS D , SMITH R , BENNETT CF, CUDKOWICZ M RESULTS OF A PHASE 1, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOSE-ESCALATION STUDY OF THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF ISIS 333611 ADMINISTERED INTRATHECALLY TO PATIENTS WITH FAMILIAL ALS DUE TO SOD1 GENE MUTATIONS Results: No dose-limiting toxicities were identified. There were no serious adverse events in ISIS33361-treated subjects. Adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and none were related to the dose level of ISIS333611. Most common AEs were related to delivery procedure. No drug-related neurological changes were observed. ALS-FRS and FVC measurements were only changed in those patients with rapidly progressing mutations. Re-enrollment was well tolerated CSF and plasma drug levels were consistent with levels predicted from preclinical studies.

The most frequent treatment-related adverse event during tolcapone treatment was elevated liver enzymes (21%). There were no significant differences between tolcapone treatment and placebo in the primary or imaging outcomes. However, there were significant differences between RBANS total scores (p < 0.01), NPI-Q total scores (p = 0.04), and CGI total scores (p = 0.035) between treatment conditions which were driven by differences between baseline and tolcapone conditions.

Single and multiple doses of TQS-168 were well tolerated in 78 healthy volunteers, and no serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. TQS-168 also demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetic properties with adequate plasma exposures. Based on these results, Tranquis plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of TQS-168 in ALS by the end of the year. The data from our Phase 1 study of TQS-168 demonstrate that target plasma exposures can be achieved at dose levels that are well tolerated. The ability to reach human exposures that were associated with benefits in preclinical models of ALS bolsters our confidence in Tranquis’ approach. We are developing an orally administered compound that targets PGC-1a in myeloid cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases in which dysfunctional myeloid cells play a key role in disease progression,” said Jonas Hannestad, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer at Tranquis. “By the end of the year, we plan to advance TQS-168 into a Phase 2 study in people living with ALS, a devastating disease with high unmet need... https://www.tranquis.com/pressrelease/tranquis-therapeutics-announces-successful-completion-of-phase-1-clinical-trial-of-tqs-168/",,TrialTroveID-411005,,,,411005,,,"June 2, 2022 ...Single and multiple doses of TQS-168 were well tolerated in 78 healthy volunteers, and no serious adverse events were reported.

Two patients have passed away and were excluded from this interim data analysis. Patient data is still blinded, so results are based on all patients regardless of their treatment arm. The mean change in ALS-FRS-R scores based on an average follow-up of 4 months was 0.72 points per month. Biomarker data has yet to be analyzed from Baseline and Final Visit LP collection. Medications have been tolerated well and labs have illustrated no clinically significant changes. Discussion: By the Symposium, several patients’ treatment regimens will be unblinded and biomarker levels will be analyzed which will give us a better understanding if this drug cocktail is efficacious and if CSF biomarker levels decline over the course of treatment. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1694",Secondary Outcome Measures: To determine if cerebrospinal fluid tau levels decline over the course of treatment and if the level of tau decline correlates with response in treatment measured by ALSFRS [ Time Frame: 3 years ].,20071808 NCT00919555 PNA TrialTroveID-093634,Primary Outcome Measures: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tretinoin and Pioglitazone HCL in patients with ALS [ Time Frame: 3 years ].,,,93634,Safety/Toxicity > Safety And Tolerability,,,Iii,,3,6,0,0,0,0,9,SAFETY,0,0,0,0

Patients’ age ranged from 38-68, and included three women and seven men. Disease duration from time of diagnosis to time of entry ranged from two months to four years. Of those enrolled, eight completed all study visits from screening through last visit. Two patients were unable to complete the study, one dropped out to enroll in a stem cell study and another due to a family emergency. Conclusion: Decreased activity of electron transport chain complex IV has been observed in the spinal cords and muscle of ALS patients. Ketone bodies, consisting essentially of D-beta-3 hydroxybutyrate (DBH) and acetoacetate, are derived from fat catabolism in liver mitochondria and are inversely proportional to the levels of glucose in the blood. Ketogenic diets are high fat, low carbohydrate diets that increase levels of circulating ketones. Protective effects of ketogenic diets have been demonstrated in several neurological disorders notably in epilepsy and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. We have previously reported the beneficial role of a ketogenic diet in improving motor function and survival of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice. This is the report of the first pilot study to look at AC1204 in patients with ALS, for ketone production in blood and urine and assess safety and tolerability for future efficacy studies.

Riluzole AUC0-inf and Cmax were dose proportional across dose ranges. Within the troriluzole dosage range of 200 to 280 mg/day, Tmax of riluzole was ~2-3 hours, with a half-life of 9-12 hours. Riluzole steady state was achieved by Day 5 of troriluzole daily dosing. Repeat dosing of troriluzole was associated with riluzole Cmax CVs from 31.6% to 41.2% and AUC CVs from 31.5% to 49.4%. No clinically meaningful riluzole accumulation was observed with once-daily dosing. Troriluzole was well tolerated up to the highest studied dose (840 mg), and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) did not increase with dose escalation. AEs were mostly mild and transient, with headache and somnolence as the most frequent events across studies. Conclusion Troriluzole was well tolerated at single doses up to 840 mg and multiple daily doses up to 280 mg, with no significant clinical safety concerns.

All 12 activities are relevant in ALS and each is scored between 0 (no function at all) and 4 (normal function). Thus the overall score for this measure can range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more normal function. The test-retest reliability is greater than 0.88 for all 12 items/activities. The ALSFRS-R declines linearly with time over a wide range during the course of ALS and the minimum clinically significant change in this scale is said to be 20%. The primary analysis in this study is the slope of the ALSFRS-R during treatment compared to pre-treatment. Pre-treatment slope for each participant will be estimated as follows: (48-enrollment ALSFRS-R)/months since symptom onset.

Most SOD1 mutation carriers (75%) had no family history of ALS and were therefore classified as apparently sporadic ALS. 23 of the 38 previously identified SOD1 mutation carriers (60.5%) were included in the ongoing EAP with Tofersen. The treat- ment was carried out in 8 specialized ALS centers. An add- itional 6 patients (16%) are eligible for treatment and in preparation for enrollment in the EAP. In total, 1.5% of all patients who participated in the genetic screening program were referred to treatment with Tofersen. Mutations in the FUS gene were identified in 15 ALS patients (1.0%). Three of the 15 patients with FUS mutations (20%) were successfully enrolled in an ongoing ASO trial for the treatment of ALS caused by FUS mutations (ION363). Conclusions: The results of this genetic screening program contribute to the notion of previous reports that SOD1 muta- tions can be detected even in apparently sporadic ALS. The frequency of SOD1 and FUS mutations relevant for participa- tion in an EAP and studies, respectively, was higher than pre- viously described. A substantial proportion of patients transitioned to Tofersen treatment after identifying SOD1 mutations. Further studies are needed to investigate the pro- portion of patients actually treated, the time interval to treat- ment, and possible barriers to accessing Tofersen therapy. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/21678421.2023.2260204?needAccess=true","Secondary objectives of the trial To further evaluate the effects of ION363 in halting, reversing, or slowing the deterioration of clinical functioning and biomarkers of disease severity in FUS-ALS patients.

The 2:1 allocation of the full study was retained in this group and included 190 treated and 95 placebo patients, which allowed us to perform an exploratory analysis to generate a hypothesis to test in a second analysis. We randomly separated the 190 treated patients into two groups, one for the exploratory analysis and a second to test the hypothesis. One-year predictions using our validated percent expected vital capacity model were made for all patients in the analysis set. A broad central region, a “hot spot,” where moderately progressing patients localized was detected and a subgroup, representing predicted one-year decline in percent expected vital capacity between 15% and 25% was selected to determine whether it could be found in the test set. Examination of the test group confirmed the results of the exploratory analysis. The Topiramate-ALS trial (1) proved useful for developing DEC analysis. In contrast to ceftriaxone, which had a positive, non-significant TE, the topiramate trial reported a negative TE for the primary endpoint. DEC analysis using decline in ALSFRS-R as the endpoint was performed and failed to see any positive hot spots. Rather, the TE matrix showed broad zones of negative TEs. This experiment provides a strong negative control for DEC analysis. Conclusion: DEC analysis provides an unbiased, innovative new framework for re-examining failed ALS drug trials and uncovering ‘hot spots’ where a prediction-defined patient subgroup could form the basis of a subsequent successful trial.

Stage 3 included 66 participants from stages 1 and 2 and 448 new participants. In total, 340 participants were randomly allocated to ceftriaxone and 173 to placebo. During stages 1 and 2, mean ALSFRS-R declined more slowly in participants who received 4 g ceftriaxone than in those on placebo (difference 0·51 units per month, 95% CI 0·02 to 1·00; p=0·0416), but in stage 3 functional decline between the treatment groups did not differ (0·09, -0·06 to 0·24; p=0·2370). No significant differences in survival between the groups were recorded in stage 3 (HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·71 to 1·15; p=0·4146). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hepatobiliary adverse events were more common in the ceftriaxone group than in the placebo group (gastrointestinal, 245 of 340 [72%] ceftriaxone vs 97 of 173 [56%] placebo, p=0·0004; hepatobiliary, 211 [62%] vs 19 [11%], p<0·0001). Significantly more participants who received ceftriaxone had serious hepatobiliary serious adverse events (41 participants [12%]) than did those who received placebo (0 participants). INTERPRETATION: Despite promising stage 2 data, stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy. The adaptive design allowed for seamless transition from one phase to another, and central venous catheter use in the home setting was shown to be feasible.; April 17, 2013 PLoS One. 2013 Apr 17;8(4):e61177. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0061177.

Design and initial results of a multi-phase randomized trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: Stage 1 analysis revealed linear pharmacokinetics, and CSF trough levels for both dosage levels exceeding the pre-specified target trough level of 1 µM (0.55 µg/mL). Tolerability (Stages 1 and 2) results showed that ceftriaxone at dosages up to 4 grams/day was well tolerated at 20 weeks. Biliary adverse events were more common with ceftriaxone but not dose-dependent and improved with ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) therapy. Conclusions: The goals of Stages 1 and 2 of the ceftriaxone trial were successfully achieved. Based on the pre-specified decision rules, the DSMB recommended the use of ceftriaxone 4 g/d (divided BID) for Stage 3, which recently closed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613806 http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0061177#close; December 8, 2009 Presented at 20th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 8-10, 2009, Berlin, Germany Cudkowicz M, Greenblatt D, Shefner J, Schoenfeld D, Delaney K, Swartz A, Pestronk A, Yu H, Sherman A, Chen M, Felsenstein D, Keroack M, Rosenfeld J, Simpson E, Pascuzzi R, Vriesendorp F, David W, Glass J, Katz J, Caress J Clinical Session 6B, Abstract C39 Ceftriaxone In Als: Results Of Stages 1 And 2 Of An Adaptive Design Safety, Pharmacokinetic And Efficacy Trial Results: STAGES 1 and 2 have been successfully completed. Ceftriaxone was found to have a volume of distribution of 13.8 liters and a plasma half-life of 8.6 hours. Plasma and CSF concentrations were closely correlated. CSF trough levels at both doses (2g and 4g) exceeded the prespecified target trough level of 1mM. At the 4g daily dosage, modeling predicted that CSF levels would stay above 1mM for 72 hours, enabling consideration of drug holidays for subjects if needed. At 20 weeks of treatment, subjects from both active treatment dose levels met the pre-specified criteria for tolerability. Discussion: The complexity of this study has required a team of clinical investigators from several fields, toxicologists, pharmacokineticists, project managers, data managers, and biostatisticians. We successfully achieved the goals of the first two STAGES of the trial and now are proceeding with STAGE 3. Conclusion: The novel activities of cephalosporins provide a unique opportunity to evaluate a single agent aimed at several pathways relevant to the pathophysiology in patients with ALS. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1668; December 1, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Abstract# P124 Swartz A, Shefner J, Yu H, Thornell B, Sherman A, Cudkowicz M Design and implementation of a multi-phase, adaptive-design clinical trial for subjects with ALS Results: The FDA required that the preclinical package support a phase III efficacy study. This included chronic animal toxicology data. To meet this requirement, we conducted two IND supportive rodent studies. The first, a short-term toxicity and dose-finding study, identified the maximum tolerated dosage for chronic subcutaneous administration in rodents (doses up to 1.0 g/kg/day tested). Subsequently, a 6-month rodent toxicology study was conducted, beginning in the summer of 2006. TheFDA allowed the human study to proceed concurrent with the 6- month rodent study. Enrollment for stage 1 and 2 of the human study began in late August of 2006 at 9USsites.Data is entered into an electronic data capture (EDC) system (Pharmacontent, Inc) and the trial is managed using a clinical trial management system (CTMS) we developed. Discussion: Using the experience from other clinical research specialities, ALS researchers have begun to utilize these ‘‘alternatives’’ to traditional phased clinical trials. The use of adaptive-design clinical trials may speed the drug discovery process. The Clinical Trial of Ceftriaxone in Subjects with ALS is one such study, utilizing a multiphase, adaptive design to combine multiple aspects of the clinical trials process. Although it requires a significantly increased amount of supportive preclinical toxicology data, we expect that this type of design will be a useful tool to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in ALS research. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925","Secondary Outcome Measures: Change in % Vital Capacity From Screening to One Year [ Time Frame: Every 12 weeks for one Year ] Vital Capacity is measured as the percent predicted per subject based on age, gender, and height, and is performed as a Slow Vital Capacity. This outcome measure calculation is based on measurements every 12 weeks from the Baseline Visit up until one year. Change From Baseline in Evaluation of Multiple Upper Extremity Muscles Using Hand Held Dynamometry at One Year [ Time Frame: Every 12 weeks for one Year ] Hand-held Dynamometry (HHD) is used to evaluate muscle strength. Six proximal muscle groups were examined bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities (shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, elbow extension, hip flexion, knee flexion, and knee extension). In addition, wrist extension, first dorsal interosseous contraction and ankle dorsiflexion were measured bilaterally. HHD analysis was performed using Percent Change from Baseline. Each subject's baseline strength value for each muscle group is considered 100%. During successive visits strength for each muscle group was measured using HHD and was calculated as a percentage of the initial baseline value recorded. Upper extremity and lower extremity values were calculated as the sum of all tests for that extremity to create one megascore for upper and one megascore for lower extremity muscles. This outcome measure calculation is based on measurements every 12 weeks from the Baseline Visit up until one year. Change From Baseline in the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Scale (ALSQOL) at One Year [ Time Frame: Every 12 weeks for one Year ] The ALS-Specific Quality of Life Scale (ALSQOL). was developed, tested, and validated in subjects with ALS, and is not a health-related quality of life scale. The scale consists of 59 questions that ask about severity of the symptoms of ALS, mood and affect, intimacy, and social issues. Each question for the ALSQOL is scored from 0-10. With 59 questions, total score ranges from 0-590 with scores simply added, with 590 representing highest quality of life. However since 10 is maximally weighted towards negative values on some questions and positive values on others, the following questions must have results transposed (Simply reverse the scale, for instance 10=0 and 0=10) prior to analysis: 1-10, 11, 16, 19, 24, 26, 28, 32, 35, 36, 38, and 41.

Results: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive patients with laboratory supported probable, clinically probable, or clinically definite ALS were evaluated from January 2006 to September 2007. Thirty-two patients (20%) were taking statin medications and 132 were in the control group. After adjusting for covariates, we found a highly significant increase in the rate of decline in the ALSFRS-R for the statin group (1.71 units/month) compared to the control group (1.05 units/month, p<0.0001) representing a 63% increase in the rate of functional decline. Patients on statin therapy also reported a significant increase in muscle cramp frequency and severity (p<0.0001). Conclusions: This study has demonstrated a strong association between statin medications and an increased rate of functional decline and muscle cramping in patients with ALS. Although this association does not prove a causal relationship, it is prudent to exercise caution and discuss discontinuation or replacement of statin medications in patients with ALS. http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17482960802031092; December 1, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Abstract# P132 Zinman L, Sadeghi R, Patton D, Kiss A Should patients with ALS Continue Taking Statin Medications? Results: The study included 131 patients with clinically probable or definite ALS followed from January 2006 to June 2007. Thirty-two patients (24%) were taking statin medications and 99 (76%) were in the control group. After adjusting for covariates, we found a highly significant increase in the rate of decline in the ALSFRS-R for the statin group (1.29 units/month) compared to the control group (0.77 units/month; p50.0015). Patients in the statin group also reported significantly greater muscle cramp frequency (pv0.0001) and severity (p50.0005). CK values were lower in the statin group, but no significant difference was found. Conclusions: This observational study demonstrates that statin medications are associated with an increased rate ofdisease progression in patients with ALS. Statins also appear to significantly increase muscle cramp frequency and severity. These findings indicate that statin medications may be harmful in patients with ALS and clinicians should consider discontinuing or replacing these medications in the context of ALS disease progression and cardiovascular risk http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=925",,TrialTroveID-121975,Primary Outcome: The predetermined exposure variable and the rate of decline of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R).

Differences in FVC, muscular strength or functional measures were not apparent between the three groups. Adverse effects were minimally associated with progesterone treatment, few complained of somnolence or gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions/Relevance: At the dose studied, patients receiving progesterone in association with riluzole showed a trend toward longer survival and proved to be free of major collateral effects. Further studies are warranted to disclose if combined therapy with progesterone might be a successful neuroprotective therapy option for ALS patients. http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan2008chicago/view.php?nu=AAN08L_P04.089",,TrialTroveID-087393,,,,87393,Efficacy > Respiratory Function,,,Ii,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,EFFICACY,0,0,0,0

The slope of AALSRS was 1.17 points/month lower while the patients were treated with UDCA than with placebo (95% CI for difference 0.08-2.26, P = 0.037), whereas the slopes of ALSFRS-R and FVC did not show significant differences between treatments. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with UDCA (P < 0.05) Conclusion: Oral solubilized UDCA seems to be tolerable in ALS patients, but we could not make firm conclusion regarding its efficacy, particularly due to the high attrition rate in this cross-over trial. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323869 Full text available: http://www.jkms.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0063JKMS/jkms-27-200.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271295/?tool=pubmed; December 01, 2007 Presented at 18th International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 1-3, 2007, Toronto, Canada Abstract # SW305 Sung J-J, Kim S-M, Kim S-Y, Hong Y-H, Park K-S, Kim D-E, Lee K-W Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial of UDCA Therapy in ALS Results: The results of this study are under statistical analysis, and will be presented at the Symposium.

Results: We randomly assigned 208 patients, of whom 5 (1 rhEPO and 4 placebo) withdrew consent and 3 (placebo) became ineligible (retinal thrombosis, respiratory insufficiency, SOD1 mutation) before receiving treatment; 103 receiving rhEPO and 97 placebo were eligible for analysis. At 12 months, the annualised rate of death (rhEPO 0.11, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.20; placebo: 0.08, CI 0.04 to 0.17), tracheotomy or >23 h NIV (rhEPO 0.16, CI 0.10 to 0.27; placebo 0.18, CI 0.11 to 0.30) did not differ between groups, also after stratification by onset and ALSFRS-R at baseline. Withdrawal due to AE was 16.5% in rhEPO and 8.3% in placebo. No differences were found for secondary outcomes.

Twenty-five Italian centers participated in the study. We screened 545 and randomized 208 patients. One patient in rhEPO and seven patients in placebo were lost at enrolment, therefore 103 patients in rhEPO and 97 patients in placebo entered the study. At baseline, arms (rhEPO and placebo, respectively) were balanced as to gender (55 men and 50 men), mean age (59.4 + or - 10; 58.6+ or - 10), onset (spinal: 73.8%, 74.2%; bulbar: 26.2%, 25.8%), median ALSFRS-R score (40 (21 – 48); 39 (20 – 48)), median sVC (87% (37 – 110), 86% (23 – 114)), median ALSAQ40 (98 (43 – 200); 97 [52 – 161]), riluzole treatment (97%; 95%). At 12-month follow-up, 38 patients dropped-out and 1 was lost in rhEPO arm, whereas 39 patients dropped-out and 2 were lost in placebo arm. Overall rates for survival (9.7% and 7.2%) and tracheotomy or more than 23-h NIV (14.6% and 15.5%) were non significantly different between rhEPO and placebo, even after stratifi cation by onset and ALSFRS-R score at baseline. ALSFRS-R decline did not signifi cantly change in rhEPO compared to placebo ( - 2, 95% CI 0 – 4), even after stratifi cation by onset and ALSFRS-R score at baseline. Conclusion: The proportion of adverse events causing drop-out was non-signifi cantly different between rhEPO and placebo arms (16.5% and 8.3%, respectively). Only three events were considered probably associated to rhEPO treatment. At 18-month follow-up, the overall rates for survival (19% and 11.8%) and tracheotomy or more than 23-h NIV (22% and 21.5%) remained non-signifi cantly different between rhEPO and placebo. In conclusion, add-on treatment with i.v. rhEPO 40.000 UI fortnightly did not reduce survival, tracheotomy or NIV rate, neither change the course of ALS over a 12-month period.

In addition, these disease modifying effects were enough to improve the functional deficits during 2 to 3 weeks after each rhEPO injection in 10 patients and more prominent in patients with short duration and rapid progression among the rhEPO group. The intravenous administration of rhEPO also had modest but significant beneficial effects including improvement of muscle power, decreased drooling, mood stabilization, and decreased spasticity. No significant adverse effects were noted. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, liver enzyme, and blood pressure remained stable. Conclusions: Intravenous rhEPO in ALS is both safe and well tolerated.

There was no difference in the dynamics of forced vital capacity (FVC) and ALSFRS scores. In the group of patients receiving therapy, we registered increased survival under hypoxic conditions. We detected high level of virus neutralizing antibodies in one patient, receiving medication, who died during the first year of therapy. No serious adverse events were registered. Discussion and Conclusions: We demonstrated safety and good tolerance of this therapy. We showed, that virus neutralizing antibodies may decrease effectiveness of therapy with recombinant adenovirus vectors. Gene therapy may increase resistance to hypoxia. http://www.mndassociation.org/document.rm?id=1271 [Page# 2/3]; April 2008 Bull Exp Biol Med. 2008 Apr;145(4):483-6.

Theme 10 Scientific & Clinical Work in progress & Care Practice Abstract# CW246 George P & Williams D Effects of Vitamin B Complex (IM) in ALS Patients. Results: Significant improvements is seen in three ALS patients who were treated. Discussion/Conclusion: ALS is a progressive disease of nerve degeneration. The B vitamins play vital roles in motor neuron function. Cyanocobalamin (B12) is important for nerve and motor neuron integrity. It is also essential for blood cell formation and is used to treat pernicious anaemia. Thiamine Hydrochloride (B1) is essential for the liberation of energy and the disposal of pyruvic acid. Riboflavine sodium phosphate is essential for tissue repair. Pyridoxine hydrochloride (B6) nicotanomide and D-Panthenol are also part of the B complex (Neurobion Forte). The recent study concludes that high levels of protein in the blood can decrease the blood vitamin B12 levels. It is suggested that Vitamin B12 therefore has to be replaced and replenished to insure regeneration and function of motor neurons. Furthermore, we found that this ALS study has been incredibly motivational for the ALS patients.

(Nasdaq: WVE), a clinical-stage RNA medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases, today announced topline results from the Phase 1b/2a FOCUS-C9 study evaluating WVE-004 as an investigational treatment for C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9-ALS/FTD). The results include data from a planned analysis of the study, where participants received multiple 10 mg doses of WVE-004 or placebo every 12 weeks (Q12W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W), as well as an additional 20 mg single dose cohort. WVE-004 was generally safe and well-tolerated across doses, with most adverse events presenting as mild in intensity. There were no clinically meaningful changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein or white blood cell count and no new safety signals since the previous data update in April 2022. Robust, sustained reductions in poly(GP) from baseline were observed, with a maximal mean reduction of 48% (p<0.0001) in the Q12W dose and 50% (p=0.0001) in the Q4W dose of WVE-004. Poly(GP) is a pharmacodynamic biomarker indicating WVE-004 is lowering C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (G4C2) transcripts, which are hypothesized to contribute to pathogenesis in C9-ALS/FTD. However, no clinical benefit was observed at 24 weeks, and reductions in poly(GP) were not associated with stabilization or improvement in functional outcomes. Based on these data, and in the absence of biomarkers reasonably likely to predict clinical outcomes, Wave has decided to discontinue development of WVE-004. Following our initial positive single dose data last year, we advanced WVE-004 with the hope that its potency and differentiated pharmacology may deliver a better result than C9orf72-targeting oligonucleotides discontinued by others in the field. While we again saw substantial reductions of poly(GP) with multiple doses, we are deeply disappointed that we were not able to see any evidence of potential benefits that would be expected to drive meaningful outcomes for these patients... ...Topline FOCUS-C9 Results The FOCUS-C9 study initially evaluated single doses of 10, 30 or 60 mg of WVE-004 or placebo. Based on potency and durability observed in the single dose cohorts, Wave added a 20 mg single dose cohort (n=8) and advanced 10 mg as the dose for the repeat dose phase, administered every 12 weeks (Q12W; n=8) or every four weeks (Q4W; n=5) and compared with placebo (n=7). Participants in the Q12W cohort receive two 10 mg doses and participants in the Q4W cohort receive four 10 mg doses; participants are followed for 24 weeks. Key observations from the planned analysis of the study include: Safety/tolerability results WVE-004 was generally safe and well-tolerated across the single and multidose cohorts (n=26 unique WVE-004-treated participants) and the most common adverse events (AEs) in the study were related to disease progression and intrathecal administration. AEs were mostly mild in intensity across all treatment groups. Among WVE-004-treated participants, there was one SAE in the study reported by the investigator as related to study drug that occurred in the 60 mg single dose cohort, as previously reported in April 2022. There was also one SAE reported that was procedure related. All other SAEs were associated with disease progression. There were no AEs indicative of antisense oligonucleotide class effects, including no clinically meaningful changes in blood chemistry or hematology. There was no evidence of inflammation in the CSF as indicated by no clinically meaningful changes in CSF white blood cell count or protein. Poly(GP) results In the multidose cohorts, the mean, maximal poly(GP) reduction from baseline was 48% (95% CI, 0.36, 0.58; p<0.0001) for the 10 mg Q12W cohort at week 16 and 50% (95% CI: 0.29, 0.64, p=0.0001) for the 10 mg Q4W cohort at week 24. In the 20 mg single dose cohort, the mean, maximal poly(GP) reduction from baseline was 51% (95% CI, 0.29, 0.67; p=0.0006) at week 24. Exploratory biomarker results: CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) NfL elevations were observed in the WVE-004 20 mg single dose cohort and the 10 mg Q4W cohort; the 10 mg Q12W cohort and placebo had overlapping confidence intervals. There was no correlation (absolute correlation coefficient <0.1) between CSF NfL increases and ALSFRS-R change. Exploratory clinical outcomes There was no benefit observed for WVE-004-treated participants compared with placebo on any exploratory clinical outcome measure, including the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). In the Q12W cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in ALSFRS-R mean change between WVE-004 and placebo at any timepoint. In the Q4W cohort, participants treated with WVE-004 showed greater reduction in ALSFRS-R mean change than placebo patients at week 24 (p<0.0001); however, ALSFRS-R scores were not statistically different from the decline seen in natural history (using a matched natural history control group from the PRO-ACT database). Additionally, there was no benefit observed for WVE-004 treated participants with FTD compared with placebo on the Dementia Staging Instrument plus National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) Behavior and Language Domains (CDR® plus NACC FTLD). Reductions in poly(GP) did not associate with improvement on ALSFRS-R and CDR plus NACC FTLD and as such, Wave determined it will discontinue development of WVE-004, including stopping the FOCUS-C9 study and the open label extension study... https://ir.wavelifesciences.com//news-releases/news-release-details/wave-life-sciences-announces-topline-results-phase-1b2a-focus-c9; November 17, 2022 [Interim Results] Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, Volume 23, Issue supplement 1, pages 1-194, November 2022 Presented at the 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND, December 6-9, 2022, San Diego, CA and Virtual Meeting Online published date: November 17, 2022 Abstract No. CLT-04 K.

Panzara A variant-selective approach in C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD): results from the FOCUS-C9 clinical trial Results: FOCUS-C9 (NCT04931862) is a global, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a trial with an adaptive design allowing for rapid assessment of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of singleand multiple-ascending intrathecal doses of WVE-004 in people with C9-ALS or C9-FTD. Initial results (up to day 85) showed significant reductions in CSF poly(GP) with single doses (10 mg, n ¼ 2; 30 mg, n ¼ 4; 60 mg, n ¼ 3) with poly(GP) concentrations not apparently reaching steady-state maximal reduction by day 85. Adverse events (AEs) were balanced across treatment groups, including placebo (n ¼ 3), and were mostly mild to moderate in intensity. Four patients, including one on placebo, experienced severe and/or serious AEs; one was reported to be related to study drug. These data suggest that single ascending doses of WVE-004 were generally safe, and reductions in CSF poly(GP) provide confirmation of target engagement with a single dose. Based on these initial data, FOCUS-C9 was adapted to evaluate additional and expanded low, single-dose cohorts. Discussion: Treatment is ongoing, with additional data from single and multiple dose cohorts expected in 2022. New data emerging from the study will also be presented. FOCUS-C9 is the first clinical trial to address both ALS and FTD caused by the C9orf72 genetic variant in the same study. Further, FOCUS-C9’s adaptive design has enabled data-driven modifications to the study to support more rapid optimization of dose level and frequency for WVE-004.

(Nasdaq: WVE), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases, today announced a positive update to the ongoing Phase 1b/2a FOCUS-C9 trial of WVE-004, the company’s clinical candidate for C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (C9-FTD). FOCUS-C9 (NCT04931862) is an adaptive trial that was designed to rapidly optimize dose level and frequency based on early indicators of target engagement. The trial update announced today is being driven by the observation of potent, durable reductions of poly(GP) dipeptide repeat proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with low, single doses of WVE-004. Poly(GP) is a key C9-ALS/C9-FTD disease biomarker that, when reduced in CSF, indicates WVE-004’s engagement of target in the brain and spinal cord. ...Reductions in poly(GP) were observed across all active treatment groups (10 mg, n=2 patients; 30 mg, n=4 patients; 60 mg, n=3 patients), reaching statistical significance versus placebo (n=3 patients) after single 30 mg doses, with a 34% reduction in poly(GP) at day 85 (p=0.011). At the time of analysis, none of the patients dosed with 60 mg had reached day 85. As the poly(GP) reduction in the 30 mg single dose cohort does not appear to have plateaued, Wave will extend the observation period from approximately three months (85 days) to approximately six months to identify the maximum reduction of poly(GP) and duration of effect of low single doses. Based on the durability and potency observed in the 30 mg cohort, FOCUS-C9 has been adapted to include additional patients receiving 20 mg and 30 mg single doses of WVE-004. Additional exploratory assessments included monitoring of CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) and clinical outcome measures. CSF NfL elevations were observed in some patients in the 30 mg and 60 mg single dose cohorts with no meaningful changes in clinical outcome measures, although the dataset and duration were not sufficient to assess clinical effects. Exploratory assessments will continue throughout the single and multidose phases of the FOCUS-C9 trial. Adverse events (AEs) were balanced across treatment groups, including placebo, and were mostly mild to moderate in intensity. Four patients (including one on placebo) experienced severe and/or serious adverse events; three were reported by the investigators to be related to ALS or administration, and one was reported by the investigator to be related to study drug. There were no treatment-associated elevations in CSF white blood cell counts or protein and no other notable laboratory abnormalities were observed. Dosing in a multidose cohort at 10 mg monthly is also well underway, and additional single and multidose data are expected throughout 2022. The company anticipates that the additional single and multidose data will be used to optimize dose level and frequency and enable discussions with regulatory authorities later this year regarding the next phase of development. “FOCUS-C9 was designed to deliver an early indication of target engagement so that we could rapidly optimize the dose and move toward the next stage of development. Based on our preclinical PK/PD modeling, we expected that relatively low doses would engage target; however, seeing this level of poly(GP) knockdown three months after a single 30 mg dose exceeded our expectations and we expect poly(GP) to reduce further with repeat administrations,” said Michael Panzara, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Therapeutics Discovery and Development at Wave Life Sciences. “The next step is to identify a regimen that maximizes knockdown with repeat dosing, while potentially enabling quarterly or less frequent dosing. We are incredibly grateful to the patients, families, researchers and clinicians in the study who helped us reach this initial milestone and we look forward to their continued partnership as we work to complete FOCUS-C9... https://ir.wavelifesciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wave-life-sciences-announces-positive-update-ongoing-phase-1b2a","Secondary objectives Plasma and CSF PK profile PolyGP in CSF Exploratory objectives Biomarkers: p75NTRECD in urine NfL in CSF Clinical endpoints ALSFRS-R: FVC CDR-FTDLD: HHD Key exploratory clinical outcome measures – ALSFRS-R and CDR-FTLD Secondary objectives of the trial Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of WVE-004 in plasma.
